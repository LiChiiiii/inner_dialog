        "clean content": "10 things to consider before starting a business\n\n1. Support from your nearest and dearest\nBefore you go any further with your idea, have a chat with your husband, wife, partner, kids, parents, and other close family members and friends. They\u2019re coming on this journey with you and you need to know that they\u2019re going to support you when things get tough.\n\n2. De-risk financially\nYou need to make some decisions about your finances before you start a business \u2013 and that includes your personal financial situation. First, reduce any unnecessary financial commitments and work out what is the minimum amount that you can live on. Think about your income \u2013 will you work full time and launch a side hustle? Or do you plan on working part time? Or are you going to go \u2018all in\u2019? Use Virgin StartUp\u2019s Personal Survival Budget template to work out your finances and come up with a timeline for how you\u2019re going to transition yourself into the business.\n\n3. Have a plan and a vision\nYou can\u2019t expect to be successful in business unless you plan. Develop a business plan, business model canvas, and cash flow forecast before you get started. Set some stretch goals to keep you focused and motivated. Studies have proven that entrepreneurs with a business plan have lower failure rates. Planning will also give you more confidence and make you consider all aspects of your business \u2013 including any \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios. Develop your vision and know your \u2018why'. This will be your north star to guide you.\n\n4. Get to know your customer\nDo a deep dive into your target customer\u2019s life. Work out what problems they have and what their view on the world is. Write down a large list of all their problems and analyze all of your results. It\u2019s likely there will be three standout trends \u2013 this is where you should focus your business. Get specific and drill down on your target customer. The more you know about your customers, the more your message will resonate, therefore the less you have to spend on marketing.\n\n5. Get to know yourself\nGetting to know yourself, as well as your customers, is just as important when starting a business. Your biggest competitor will be yourself. Remember that your self-worth is not based on the success or failure of your business. Do not let it be all-consuming. To get to know yourself a bit better, take a personality test such as a Myers Briggs test or DISC profiling \u2013 or you could check out the entrepreneurial personality test on the Enterprise Orchard website.\n\n6. Sell it before you build it\nThe idea that \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d doesn\u2019t work for start-ups. You need to make sure that people actually want what you\u2019re making. Get sign-ups, pre-sales, any form of financial commitment. This is your proof of demand. Potential sales are often worthless \u2013 people\u2019s outlook on the future is less tangible and unfortunately skewed. Instead, consider options such as crowdfunding to kickstart your business and build sales.\n\n7. Find a mentor\nHaving a mentor with more experience than you can prove invaluable in the start-up world. Mentors have been there, done it, and got the t-shirt. They can help you make better strategic decisions, reach your goals quicker, and open doors for you. When you take a Virgin StartUp loan, you get a mentor for six months.\n\n8. Develop networks with other founders\nThere are loads of other people who are starting businesses right now \u2013 and facing the same challenges that you are. Get to know them, and it could prove very useful for your business. Peer learning can double your profitability. Virgin StartUp\u2019s community gives you access to other founders who are on the same journey as you. They also run regular events where you can meet other entrepreneurs.\n\n9. Patience, perseverance, and the right mindset\nIt takes time to build a successful business. You can\u2019t expect to be an overnight success. Building a business takes time, bags of grit, and determination. Developing the right mindset will be one of your greatest assets. Learn to get comfortable with the uncomfortable. Podcasts are a great resource for gaining insights about how to think like an entrepreneur. The Founded & Grounded podcast interviews a new startup business owner every fortnight.\n\n10. Don\u2019t forget to have fun\nMost importantly of all, remember to have some fun. Build relationships, not sales. Do unexpected things to surprise your customers. At the end of the day, business is all about people. For more advice on starting a business and to apply for a start-up loan, visit Virgin StartUp.",

But despite the countless sacrifices and challenges small business owners face, an overwhelming 84 percent of small business owners would do it all over again. If you\u2019re thinking about taking the plunge and starting a business of your own, there are some key steps you need to take first. Below are some of the top tips I have given through mentoring over 1000 SCORE clients and acting as an angel investor. These tips spring from what I see successful entrepreneurs do and what I see those who come up short not do. Here are the 10 things you need to do before starting a business:\n\n1. Develop a powerful message\nWhat customer problem are you solving that potential customers are willing to pay for? This is often called the value proposition. Also, why will your business be operationally and financially successful?\n\n2. Focus on the customer and fully understand the market\nThere are many examples of companies that do not have the best product/service or are not first to market, yet are very successful because they have mastered startup marketing and sales. Research the demographics of your potential customer base and understand their buying habits. Watch competitors, talk with similar businesses, browse your competitors\u2019 websites, and understand what their customers are saying about them on social media.\n\n3. Start small and grow\nIf possible, self-fund your business idea and then go for funding when you can create a growth story. This might cause you to break up your product/service offering into smaller pieces so you can fund the early stages and get some traction and experience.\n\n4. Understand your own strengths, skills, and time available\nWhen running a business, know when you need to engage an accountant, lawyer, insurance agent, marketing specialist, web page designer, or other professional. This will start your management process as a business owner. Constant Contact offers a variety of professional marketing services for those who need professional assistance or want to jumpstart their online marketing efforts.\n\n5. Surround yourself with advisors and mentors\nLaunching and growing a business is difficult, and more than half will fail within 5 years. No one person can have all the knowledge, experience, or even perspective to handle every business situation. Gain from others\u2019 skills and experiences.\n\n6. Get a mentor\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to find a mentor, SCORE is a great place to start. SCORE mentors are free \u2014 just visit www.SCORE.org to find a face-to-face mentor near you or a mentor to contact via email or Skype. Also at this site are many free workshops, webinars, and templates all focused on helping entrepreneurs successfully start and grow a business. You can also find mentors on sites like LinkedIn, by attending a local small business meetup, or just asking around. You might be surprised at people in your circles who can offer useful advice based on their experiences.\n\n7. Write a business plan\nStarting a business is difficult and risky; it\u2019s easy to spend all your time and resources at it. Before you start, figure out what type of business you will have. Will it be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or LLC? Then put together your plan. Having a written plan with your projected results and personal goals is the best way to stay on track. As an example, your business may make a $20,000 profit. But if you live in a large city, support a family and maybe elderly parents, and are trying to save for kids\u2019 college and retirement, then most likely $20,000 is not enough. Don\u2019t try to do everything at once either. Focusing on the key components of a business plan will put your ideas in concrete terms and help you identify places to change the business model where necessary.\n\n8. Know your numbers\nHave a good grasp on the numbers that tell you how your business is doing and what you can expect. These include your start-up costs, sales, projected profits, cash flow, and much more, depending on the nature of your business and how you define success. You will be making many decisions \u201con the fly\u201d and knowing the numbers \u2014 the business economics \u2014 will help ensure you make the right decisions. Look for ways to cut costs where you can. Use cost-effective tools like email marketing and social media marketing to drive awareness, rather than pricier traditional advertising methods.\n\n9. Understand there are no entitlements\nDon\u2019t underestimate this one: You will work hard for all your achievements. Being a small business owner is one of the hardest jobs around. In a recent survey, 40 percent of small business owners said they don\u2019t take vacations and have their money tied up in their business.\n\n10. Have a passion for what you are doing\nBeing a business founder can be very lonely and there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish everything. From big successes to large letdowns, if you\u2019re not fueled by passion at every step of the way, your job becomes that much harder. Remember why you started your business and let your passion drive you continuously.\n\nWhen in doubt, don\u2019t go it alone\nJust because you\u2019re taking your ideas and turning them into reality doesn\u2019t mean you need to figure everything out on your own. There are plenty of online marketing tools available to make your job as a small business owner easier. But tools aren\u2019t everything. To position yourself for success, you\u2019ll need to tap into the expertise of those who are experienced in the small business world of the digital age. A good place to start is with The Download, Constant Contact\u2019s free online marketing guide. It takes you through all the basics of online marketing, step-by-step, in a way that\u2019s approachable and easy to understand. Sometimes a guide isn\u2019t enough and you need additional support. That\u2019s ok, too! Ask around to friends and family who have dabbled in small business, go online and connect with a mentor, or if you don\u2019t know where to start, give Constant Contact a call at 1-888-IDK-MKTG (1-888-435-6584) and speak with a marketing advisor. You\u2019ve got this!",

        "clean content": "12 Steps to Take Before Opening a Business\n\n1. Identify a creative idea.\n2. Write a business plan.\n3. Choose a legal structure.\n4. Get your business registration, licenses and tax identification.\n5. Know your competition and the marketplace.\n6. Finance your business.\n7. Identify and secure a location.\n8. Get proper insurance.\n9. Obtain legal counsel.\n10. Establish a web presence.\n11. Use local and national business resources.\n12. Create a marketing plan.\n\nWhile no two businesses are exactly the same, there are common steps entrepreneurs and potential business owners must take before opening the doors of a new company.\n\nWhen it comes to launching a new business venture, the intrepid American spirit hasn't suffered in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a record 5.4 million new business applications were filed in 2021. It may be the right time for you, too, to embark on starting a new company. Before doing this, however, there are essential steps entrepreneurs need to take.\n\n1. Identify a creative idea.\nThe most successful businesses all started from the same place: an idea. Think of a business idea as the seed of your company. You need that before you can begin adding fertilizer, watering and growing complementary plants. In other words, before you can do all the steps below, make sure you have a solid idea for your new company \u2013 it's what your business hinges on. What is a unique service you can provide? Where is there a gap in the marketplace that you can fill? Consider these cheap business ideas for inspiration.\n\n2. Write a business plan.\nAfter identifying a business idea, experts agree that writing a business plan is the next step you should take. Creating a business plan displays a genuine level of commitment, but it also forces prospective business owners to answer essential and sometimes challenging questions at the start of the development process. A business plan is also the first thing any potential investor will request. It will give them a detailed overview of your proposed business venture, your level of industry expertise and understanding of the opportunity, and the financial requirements and potential upside.\n\n3. Choose a legal structure.\nSelecting the proper legal structure for your business at the outset is critical, especially since it's not an easy change to make after the fact. Each type of legal entity comes with specific requirements and restrictions, and only certain types of corporations may apply to your particular business needs. If you need help, a corporate attorney or experienced business accountant can offer timely and accurate advice for creating the proper legal structure for your proposed company.\n\n4. Get your business registration, licenses and tax identification.\nOnce your business structure is in place, you need to register your business and obtain the correct licenses, taxpayer identification number (TIN) and employer identification number (EIN). There are various resources to assist with business names, filing incorporation paperwork, obtaining necessary licenses and registrations with your local municipality, and getting your federal tax information squared away. Aside from the IRS for federal tax matters, regional corporation commissions (typically at the county level) can assist any new business owner with meeting the regulatory requirements for each locale around the country. If you're planning on hiring staff to help run your business, you'll also need to apply for a federal tax ID or an EIN. Having an EIN will protect you and your identity, allow you to file business taxes separate from your personal taxes and help establish credit for your business.\n\n5. Know your competition and the marketplace.\nThere's nothing wrong with a bit of competition. It allows business owners to innovate and evolve their products and services continuously. Knowing your business's market, what your competition is doing and how your company fits into this landscape is critical in establishing your business. Including this information in your business plan will showcase your thorough knowledge of the industry for your proposed company. Without this information, no serious investor will rise to the occasion, and it will be hard to stand out in the marketplace. Know your industry, know your competition and understand how your business will become a differentiator in the market.\n\n6. Finance your business.\nUnless you're an accountant, have a degree in finances or are a sophisticated investor, you'll need some help nailing down this part of your pre-launch planning. Investors will want to know how much money your company will have to begin with and how much it will need in the future. Regardless of where your revenue will come from, list it in your business plan. Will you use your credit cards and home equity to start? Will you need a loan to get started? Are you willing to give up a percentage of your ownership in exchange for cash? Will you have sales the day you open your door? These are all critical questions to address.\n\n7. Identify and secure a location.\nWhether it's a home office or an entire building in an industrial park, you need to know where your business will be located before you launch it. Prior to your first day of operations, you'll want to have the following in place:\n- Phone and internet service\n- Business directory listings\n- Utilities\n- Lease or purchase agreement for your workspace\nIf you haven't identified or secured a location for your business before meeting with investors, don't fret. Investors, bankers and legal counsel generally don't see the lack of a specific location early on as a dealbreaker or red flag.\n\n8. Get proper insurance.\nSelecting the right business insurance for your company is not a decision to make lightly. There are several types of insurance to consider, including health, auto, directors and officers, liability, performance bond, travel (including AD&D) and life. In addition to understanding the differences between the available options, it's important to identify any local regulations that might require your type of business to carry certain types of insurance. For example, if you're starting a carpentry or plumbing company, you'll need liability insurance, which typically isn't necessary for businesses in other industries.\n\n9. Obtain legal counsel.\nWhether you want to have in-house counsel or hire an attorney as needed, your business needs to have access to legal advice. You may need legal representation specializing in corporate, tax, intellectual property, labor, or international law. Wherever regulatory requirements demand compliance, asking a lawyer to review and sign off on this part of your business will save you time and money and protect you from potential legal ramifications.\n\n10. Establish a web presence.\nIn addition to securing your business's physical location, you'll also need to establish a virtual presence on the web. First, you'll want to register a domain name that matches your business's name so you're ready to build your website when the time comes. Then, once you're ready to develop your website, research the options available to ensure you're selecting the best website builder that will meet your immediate needs and be able to support your desired functionality in the future, such as online ordering capabilities. Enlist the help of an SEO expert before starting so that they can ensure your website's design and content are fully optimized. You may also want to consider the cost of starting an online business when deciding which kind of company to start.\n\n11. Use local and national business resources.\nThere are plenty of local, county and national resources to make sure your business name is available, verify the legal structure you've chosen is correct and in compliance with location-specific ordinances, and advise on the different business loan options and other funds available to entrepreneurs. You can also refer to resources provided by your local corporation commission, the Small Business Administration and the IRS throughout the planning process.\n\n12. Create a marketing plan.\nWriting a marketing plan that complements your overall business plan will help ensure your new business's success. A fully optimized website should be at the center of your marketing plan, even if you're planning a brick-and-mortar business.",

        "clean content": "7 Factors To Consider When Choosing A Career\n\nWhat factors should you consider when planning your career? Well, there are SO MANY factors to consider when choosing a career. And when you\u2019re young, it\u2019s a decision that weighs heavy on you. What if you make the wrong choice? What if you end up hating a job you really thought you\u2019d love?\n\nTo help calm your nerves and give clarity, we created this guide on seven factors to consider when choosing a career. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nTable of contents\n7 Key decision-making factors to consider when choosing a career\nWhat personal factors should you consider?\nHow do you decide on a career?\nWhy do you struggle with choosing a career?\nArticles related to choosing a career\n\nThese are the top factors to consider when choosing a career!\n\n7 Key decision-making factors to consider when choosing a career\n\nThroughout our lives, we are constantly faced with choices. Some of these choices are small and inconsequential, while others have the potential to shape our lives in profound ways. One of the most important choices we will ever make is choosing a career path.\n\nWith that in mind, you may be wondering: What are the factors to consider when choosing a career?\n\nHere are seven big ones:\n\n1. Your passions and interests\nThe first factor to consider when planning a career is to think about your passions and interests. Ultimately, what makes you happy?\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re passionate about building others up, you might want to consider a career in social work or teaching. If you\u2019re excited by the prospect of travel and adventure, you might look into careers in the travel industry or the military. And if you\u2019re motivated by the challenge of problem-solving, you might want to consider engineering or another STEM field.\n\nNo matter what your goals are, there\u2019s a career out there that\u2019s perfect for you. By taking the time to think through what you want from life, you can find the path that leads to the happiness and success you\u2019re looking for.\n\n2. Your desired salary\nWhat are the factors to consider when choosing a career when it comes to your salary?\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to choose a career that you enjoy, you also want to make sure you\u2019ll be able to support yourself financially.\n\nThat said, there are a number of resources you can use to evaluate salaries for different careers. Two great places to start are Glassdoor and PayScale. These sites also have online salary calculators to help you get an idea of how much you can expect to earn based on your education, location, and experience level.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re interested in teaching, you may want to compare the average salaries of teachers in different states. You may also want to research the salaries of teachers at different levels (elementary, middle, and high school) and with different amounts of experience.\n\nAll of these factors will make sure you choose a career that meets your financial needs as well as your personal interests.\n\n3. Education requirements\nWhat are the factors to consider when choosing a career when it comes to education requirements?\n\nWhile some careers only require on-the-job training, others may require you to invest years (and tens of thousands of dollars) into your education. And with the average student loan debt being around $40,000, it\u2019s crucial to make sure the salary you can expect to earn is worth the potential debt you may have to take on.\n\nFor example, the average law student graduates with $160,000 in student loan debt. By contrast, they can expect to earn around $127,990 per year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, many real estate agents only need to pass a real estate exam to get started and can make $60,000 a year or more depending on their location.\n\nLong story short, make sure you\u2019re aware of the upfront cost you may have to put into pursuing a particular career.\n\n4. Work/life balance\nSo what are some other factors to consider when choosing a career? One you may not have thought about is work/life balance.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, it\u2019s all too easy to get caught up in the rat race and sacrifice your personal life in the name of career success. However, this can lead to burnout, health problems, and unhappiness.\n\nSome careers are notorious for having almost no work/life balance. For instance, construction managers, lawyers, financial analysts, and doctors all usually work more than 40 hours a week.\n\nIf these hours work for you, that\u2019s great. But if you want a job that gives you a life outside of work, you may want to consider a career with flexible hours, the option to work remotely, or ample time off. And if you have kids, there are even great jobs for stay-at-home moms.\n\nRemember, your career should enhance your life, not consume it. By finding a good work/life balance that works for you, you can have a successful career and a rich personal life.\n\n5. Travel requirements\nTravel requirements are among the top factors you should consider when planning a career. Some jobs come with lots of travel opportunities, while others have little to no travel.\n\nConsider which type of career would match your personal lifestyle goals and preferences.\n\nIf you want to see the world, a career that involves frequent travel may be a good fit for you. This could include working in fashion, sales, event planning, or even the air travel industries.\n\nHowever, if you prefer to stay closer to home, a stationary career in a field like accounting, engineering, and education (among countless others) may be a better choice.\n\n6. Opportunities for growth and development\nAnother major factor you should consider when planning a career is the opportunity for growth and development. Will you be able to advance in a particular career over time, or are you likely to reach a dead end after a few years?\n\nSome careers have very limited upward mobility, while others provide multiple opportunities for advancement.\n\nFor example, entry-level positions in many corporate environments offer the potential to move up the ladder into management roles. In contrast, jobs that are based on hourly wages often have little room for advancement. Other careers, such as entrepreneurship, offer unlimited potential for growth.\n\nAs you weigh your options, research how much room for growth and development a prospective career path has. That way you know what to expect five, ten, or fifteen years from now.\n\n7. Job market outlook\nOne of the most important factors to consider when choosing a career is the job market outlook. The last thing you want to do is invest your time, money, and energy into a career that isn\u2019t going to be in demand. So, for this next tip, research the job market in your chosen career field and location.\n\nLuckily, there are a number of websites to help you do this:\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is a great place to start. It provides detailed information on employment trends and projections. Simply enter your desired job title into the search engine, and you\u2019ll be able to see how the job market is expected to change in the coming years.\n\nGlassdoor and CareerBuilder are other great resources for researching job market outlooks. In addition to providing insights from current and former employees, they offer data on things like average salary and benefits.\n\nCombined, this information can be invaluable in helping you choose a career path that\u2019s not only personally satisfying but also has good long-term prospects.\n\nExpert tip\nAs you work on choosing a career, be sure to prioritize what\u2019s most important to you. For instance, traveling to interesting places for work might be something you want to do and so you might have this at the top on your list of key factors. Alternatively, you might have young children and want to spend time with them and so a job that offers flexible working hours and a good work/life balance might be your top priority.\n\nWhat personal factors should you consider when planning a career?\n\nSo what factors should you consider when planning a career? Beyond these seven factors, I have some great advice for any young woman who feels overwhelmed trying to figure it all out:\n\nDo what makes you happy\nFirst and foremost, follow your heart and do what makes you happy. Far too often, people choose a career based on external factors such as money or prestige. While these factors to consider when choosing a career may provide some level of satisfaction in the beginning, they aren\u2019t likely to lead to lasting happiness. Instead, focus on what truly brings you joy when choosing a career. It\u2019s what will matter most in the end.\n\nBe open to trying new things\nTrying new things is also an important part of finding a job you love. It\u2019s okay to pivot a few times before landing on your perfect match. For example, I started my career as an academic advisor at a university. I loved helping students plan out their class schedules and stay on track for graduation. But after two years, I realized I would never make the amount of money I needed to feel financially secure. So, I decided to try something new. I broke into freelance copywriting and have since spent years building up my career. Now, I absolutely love what I do and make more money than I could have ever earned as an academic advisor. And who knows, maybe one day I\u2019ll try something new again. The important thing is to be open to new experiences and to never stop learning.\n\nKnow that it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t do what you went to college for\nLastly, know that it\u2019s okay if you end up doing something totally different than what you went to college for. It\u2019s okay if you never have the \u201cperfect\u201d career in mind. Very few people stay in their first-choice career forever. Over time, you get a better sense of what you like and dislike. And as that happens, it\u2019s okay to adjust course if you find out a particular career isn\u2019t for you.\n\nHow do you decide on a career?\n\nUltimately deciding on a career means taking several key factors into consideration. These factors include your passions and interests, your desired salary, the education requirements, work/life balance, opportunities for growth and development, job location, and more.\n\nAnswering questions like, \u201cDo I see myself doing this long term?\u201d and \u201cWill I find joy in the work I do in this career field?\u201d can help you with making your decision.\n\nWhy do you struggle with choosing a career?\n\nIf you are struggling with choosing a career, it could be that your personal and career goals you want to accomplish are not clear. So start by asking yourself the following questions:\n\nWhen it comes to a career, what\u2019s most important to you?\nHow do you imagine your ideal workday?\nWhere would you like to see your career in the next five years?\n\nAnswering these questions can help you set a clear vision for yourself, and in turn, you can lay out your goals and priorities accordingly.\n\nArticles related to choosing a career\n\nIf you liked this article on the 5 factors to consider when choosing a career, check out these related topics:\n\nThe 15 Best Jobs For Moms With No Degree\nThe Best Networking Tips To Boost Your Career\nWhat Does A 5-Figure Salary Get You?\nHow To Avoid Making Rash Decisions In Your Career\n\nIn conclusion, there are seven main factors to consider when choosing a career. But each one will rank differently on your personal scale of importance. Maybe your top priority is finding a job that pays to travel. Or maybe it\u2019s finding a job that doesn\u2019t require a degree.\n\nWhatever it is, focus on the factors that matter most to you \u2014 and know that Clever Girl Finance has plenty of resources to help along the way.\n\nFrom 100% free courses on finding a higher-paying job and increasing income streams to helpful YouTube videos and podcast episodes, we\u2019ve got all the financial literacy tools to help you win.

        "clean content": "What To Consider When Choosing A Career: The Important Factors\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to think that there was a time when people didn\u2019t choose careers but fell into them. A job was about two things; supporting yourself and providing shelter for your loved ones. However, times have changed, and a career is much more than a means to an end; it\u2019s a future.\n\nMany people struggle when choosing a career, and statistics suggest that only one-third of UK workers are happy with their current jobs (2I Recruit). Finding the right employment is central to a person\u2019s happiness, and there are numerous considerations before leaping into a career.\n\nWhat you study, how far you go in education, and your skills will all define the avenues open to you, so planning is essential to ending up in a career you love.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll reveal what to consider when choosing a career so that you can plan your future.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nYour Interests & Passion\n\nThe starting point for many people when choosing a career is their interests. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you\u2019re passionate about? What are the things you love doing?\n\nFor example, if you love animals, working with them could be a great option, and numerous careers would allow you to do this. Alternatively, if you\u2019re passionate about fashion, a career in design or styling could be perfect for you.\n\nOf course, your interests don\u2019t always have to match your future career directly. However, they can give you ideas of what direction to go. For example, studying law might not seem like an obvious choice if you\u2019re interested in history. However, both law and history are about research, critical thinking, and analyzing evidence, so they have a lot in common.\n\nYour Skills & Qualifications\n\nYour skills and qualifications will play a significant role in choosing your future career. After all, certain positions require specific skills and experience that you might not have yet.\n\nFor example, you\u2019ll need to complete an intensive medical degree to be a doctor. Alternatively, to be an engineer, you\u2019ll need to study mathematics and science to a high level.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that your future is set in stone from the moment you start studying. There are always ways to change direction or gain new qualifications later on. However, it\u2019s essential to be realistic about the options open to you and the amount of work that might be required.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t perform well at school and hate academics, learning a trade could be the perfect option, as it opens up doors but is a more practical field of study. Companies such as the Skills Training Group offer courses in the most lucrative trades, including plumbing and electrics.\n\nYour Personality\n\nYour personality type can reveal a lot about the kind of career that would suit you best. For example, working in a fast-paced environment with lots of people might not be ideal if you\u2019re an introvert. Alternatively, if you love socializing and meeting new people, a job that involves customer service could be perfect for you.\n\nThe Myers-Briggs personality test gives people an idea of how they interact with others and reveals the kinds of careers that might be suitable. It\u2019s a great test to take if you\u2019re unsure and can remove any ambiguity about your future.\n\nPreferences & Lifestyle\n\nIt\u2019s also worth considering your preferences when choosing a career. For example, do you prefer working alone or as a team? Do you like working outdoors or indoors? Do you want a job with a lot of travel or one you can do from home?\n\nYour lifestyle choices will also play a role in your decision. People with young children might need a job that offers flexible working hours or provides childcare. Alternatively, if you\u2019re planning on starting a family soon, you might want to consider a career that provides good maternity/paternity leave and childcare options.\n\nWorking hours are another vital factor in your decision, as specific careers require more dedication than others. For example, farmers, gardeners, and waste disposal professionals have longer working weeks, while professionals in office-based roles average around 35 hours per week.\n\nThe Job Market & Future Prospects\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how times have changed in the past four decades, and many popular jobs no longer exist anymore. Technology will continue to render some careers obsolete (Flex Jobs).\n\nConsidering the job market and prospects when choosing a career is essential, as you want to ensure that opportunities will be available once you\u2019ve qualified.\n\nFor example, there was a time when people everywhere began to learn about computers, which was a huge career opportunity. However, while these jobs still exist, computers are becoming more advanced, and some roles won\u2019t be around in the future.\n\nSome industries are growing rapidly, such as wireless technology, artificial intelligence, and renewable energy, so it\u2019s worth considering which area offers the most security.\n\nEarning Potential\n\nLast, it\u2019s essential to consider your earning potential when choosing a career. After all, you want to make sure that you can support yourself (and your family) comfortably.\n\nOf course, money isn\u2019t everything, and you shouldn\u2019t choose a job simply because it pays well. However, it is something that you should take into account as it will have a big impact on your quality of life.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to research the earning potential of different careers. For example, sites like Glassdoor offer salary information for various roles worldwide. Alternatively, you could speak to people who already work in the industry to get an idea of what they earn.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSo, there you have it; the things to consider when choosing your future career. There are plenty of opportunities available, so don\u2019t be afraid to evaluate your skills and look at the kind of work that will make you happy.\n\nRemember, no matter how old you are, it\u2019s never too late to change careers and retrain for a job that will offer you the emotional and financial rewards you deserve.",

Write down the reasons you get up in the morning and see if there are any common links between your passions and skills.\n\n2.

Use filters on websites like Salary.com, Glassdoor, or PayScale to get an idea of how much certain professions pay in relation to the cost of living in specific regions.\n\n7.

Look for resources like the Occupational Outlook Handbook by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to gain insight into the fastest-growing and most in-demand careers.\n\n8.

Consider the timeline and costs associated with obtaining the necessary qualifications.\n\n9.

Talk to family members or professionals in fields of interest for informational interviews.\n\n10. Your learning opportunities: Set up informational interviews with professionals in industries you're interested in. Prepare questions, offer assistance, and learn about networking as you progress in your career path.\n\nNow that you have an idea of potential careers and majors, you can search for colleges that offer relevant programs.

What Kind of Lifestyle Would You Like to Live?\nYour lifestyle preferences are important to consider when choosing a career. Do you want a career that allows you to spend more time with your family?

        "clean content": "What should I think about before raising a child?\n\nRaising a child is a full-time job. Thinking ahead about the challenges you'll face and the support you'll need can help you prepare to be the best parent you can be.\n\nWhat support will I need if I have a child?\n\nWhether you're a single parent or parenting with someone else, a child needs nonstop care and attention. Having a partner and/or family members to share the work of parenting makes the job a lot easier. Most parents need help, especially when it comes to money and time. The kind of support parents often need includes help with running errands, getting clothes and baby supplies (hand-me-downs are really helpful), babysitting, and just having someone to talk with.\n\nParenting with a partner is usually easier than parenting alone, but it can put some serious stress on even the best relationships. Raising a child on your own has unique benefits and challenges. Either way, being realistic about your day-to-day life and the support you'll need is important when you're thinking about raising a child.\n\nHow will parenting work with my partner and me?\n\nParenting with a romantic partner or a co-parent helps both parents feel supported, and many couples enjoy sharing the responsibility of raising a child. Creating a family with someone can be really rewarding, and it may even bring you closer together.\n\nBut most people find that having a child tests even the strongest relationship in ways they don't expect. Sometimes the stress is just too much and the relationship doesn't last.\n\nEither way, your relationship with your partner will change when you have a baby. Parenting together takes good communication and a commitment to stick through the hard times. If you're considering parenting with a partner, here are some questions to think about:\n\n- Is our relationship healthy enough to provide a loving and stable home for a child?\n- Do we agree on when to have a baby?\n- Will we communicate openly and honestly with each other?\n- Will we share the financial responsibility of caring for our child?\n- Will we share the day-to-day work of caring for our child?\n- Do we agree on how child care and/or daycare is going to work?\n- Can we deal with the strains that pregnancy and raising a child puts on relationships?\n- If our relationship ends, how would we continue to parent?\n\nTalking about these questions together can help you figure out if the two of you have similar expectations about having a baby. No matter what, parenting with someone else takes teamwork, patience, and compromise. It works best when both people are deeply committed and agree on what they each expect from the relationship and raising a child together.\n\nHow do I parent without a partner?\n\nMany people find themselves parenting on their own, or they choose to become single parents. Being a single parent can be tough, but it's definitely not impossible. Plenty of people do it, and many single-parent families are healthy and happy. Parenting on your own has unique advantages, too. You won't have to make compromises with a partner, so you can raise your child exactly the way you want \u2014 with your values, principles, and beliefs.\n\nFor most people, raising a child on their own is also super challenging. The responsibility for your child is 100% on you, and you may have to make a lot of sacrifices that you don't expect. For example, it may be harder to find and keep a romantic relationship as a single parent.\n\nIf you're planning to raise a child without a partner, questions about money, career or school, and other types of support can be even more important. Ask yourself:\n\n- What would raising a baby by myself mean for my future goals and plans?\n- How much support will I have from my friends, family, and community?\n- Can I handle the financial responsibility of caring for a child on my own?\n- Can I handle the day-to-day work of caring for a child on my own?\n- Who will take care of my child when I'm working or going to school? Can I afford child care?\n- Is there someone I trust who is willing to take care of my child at the last minute if I get sick or have to stay late somewhere?\n- How will I feel if having a child makes it hard to find a romantic relationship?\n\nIf you're thinking about parenting on your own, talk with your family and friends about the help you'll need. Be realistic about how much time, energy, and money the people in your life can give to you and your baby. You may also be able to get help from certain government programs, but they usually only cover part of what you need to provide for your child.\n\nI'm ready to have a baby. What should I do now?\n\nHaving a healthy pregnancy starts BEFORE you get pregnant. Once you've decided you're ready to have a baby, visit a doctor or your local Planned Parenthood health center for preconception care. Your nurse or doctor will talk with you about things like your physical health, your mental health, your diet, and your lifestyle. They'll also give you any exams or screenings you might need so you can go into your pregnancy as healthy as possible.\n\nContact your local Planned Parenthood health center to make an appointment for preconception care, or for help finding a doctor in your area. Some local health departments or community health clinics may also provide preconception care.",

Preconception health and health care focus on things you can do before and between pregnancies to increase the chances of having a healthy baby. For some people, getting their bodies ready for pregnancy takes a few months. For other people, it might take longer. Whether this is your first, second, or sixth baby, the following are important steps to help you get ready for the healthiest pregnancy possible.\n1. Make a Plan and Take Action\nWhether or not you\u2019ve written them down, you\u2019ve probably thought about your goals for having or not having children, and how to achieve those goals. For example, when you didn\u2019t want to have a baby, you used effective birth control methods. Now that you\u2019re thinking about getting pregnant, it\u2019s important to take steps to achieve your goal\u2014getting pregnant and having a healthy baby!\nHealthfinder Tool\nMake sure you are up to date on preventive services. See which screening tests and vaccines you or your loved ones need to stay healthy.\nMore\n2. See Your Doctor\nBefore getting pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about preconception health care. Your provider will want to discuss your health history and any medical conditions you currently have that could affect a pregnancy. They may want to discuss any previous pregnancy problems, medicines you currently are taking, vaccinations you might need, and steps you can take before pregnancy to help prevent certain birth defects.\nTake a list of talking points so you don\u2019t forget anything. Be sure to talk to your doctor about:\nMedical Conditions\nIf you currently have any medical conditions, be sure they are under control and being treated. Some of these conditions include: sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), diabetes, thyroid disease, high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases.\nLifestyle and Behaviors\nTalk with your healthcare provider if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use certain drugs; live in a stressful or abusive environment; or work with or live around toxic substances. Health-care professionals can help you with counseling, treatment, and other support services.\nMedications\nAlmost every pregnant person will face a decision about taking medicines before and during pregnancy. Talk to your healthcare providers before starting or stopping any medicines. Be sure to discuss the following with your healthcare providers:\nAll medicines you take, including prescriptions, over-the-counter medicines, herbal and dietary supplements, and vitamins\nBest ways to keep any health conditions you have under control\nYour personal goals and preferences for the health of you and your baby\nVaccinations (shots)\nMost vaccines are safe during pregnancy and some, such as the flu vaccine and Tdap (adult tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine), are specifically recommended during pregnancy. Having the right vaccinations at the right time can help keep you healthy and help protect your baby from some diseases during the first few months of life.\n3. Get 400 Micrograms of Folic Acid Every Day\nFolic acid is a B vitamin. Having enough folic acid in your body at least 1 month before and during pregnancy can help prevent major birth defects of the developing baby\u2019s brain and spine (anencephaly and spina bifida). CDC urges all people who can become pregnant to get 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid each day, from fortified foods or supplements, or a combination of the two, in addition to a varied diet rich in folate.\nLearn more about folic acid \u00bb\n4. Stop Drinking Alcohol, Smoking, and Using Certain Drugs\nSmoking, drinking alcohol, and using certain drugs can cause many problems during pregnancy, such as premature birth, birth defects, and infant death.\nIf you are trying to get pregnant and cannot stop drinking, smoking, or using drugs, contact your healthcare provider, local Alcoholics Anonymous, or local alcohol treatment center.\nAlcohol and Drug Resources\nSubstance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has a treatment facility locator. This locator helps people find drug and alcohol treatment programs in their area.\nAlcoholics Anonymous (A.A.)\nAlcoholics Anonymous\u00ae is a fellowship of people who come together to solve their drinking problem. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about their drinking problem. A.A.\u2019s primary purpose is to help alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

Avoid Toxic Substances and Environmental Contaminants\nAvoid harmful chemicals, environmental contaminants, and other toxic substances such as synthetic chemicals, some metals, fertilizer, bug spray, and cat or rodent feces around the home and in the workplace. These substances can hurt the reproductive systems of men and women. They can make it more difficult to get pregnant. Exposure to even small amounts during pregnancy, infancy, childhood, or puberty can lead to diseases.

Reach and Maintain a Healthy Weight\nPeople who are overweight or obese have a higher risk for many serious conditions, including complications during pregnancy, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon).1 People who are underweight are also at risk for serious health problems.2 The key to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight isn\u2019t about short-term dietary changes. It\u2019s about a lifestyle that includes healthy eating and regular physical activity.\nIf you are underweight, overweight, or obese, talk with your doctor about ways to reach and maintain a healthy weight before you get pregnant.\nLearn more about healthy weight \u00bb\n7. Learn Your Family History\nCollecting your family\u2019s health history can help you identify factors that might affect your baby during infancy or childhood or your ability to become pregnant. You might not realize that your sister\u2019s heart defect or your cousin\u2019s sickle cell disease could affect your baby, but sharing this family history information with your doctor can be important.\nBased on your family health history, your doctor might refer you for genetic counseling. Other reasons for genetic counseling include having had several miscarriages, infant deaths, or trouble getting pregnant (infertility), or having a genetic condition or birth defect that occurred during a previous pregnancy.\nLearn more about family history \u00bb\nLearn more about genetic counseling \u00bb\n8. Get Mentally Healthy\nMental health is how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. To be at your best, you need to feel good about your life and value yourself. Everyone feels worried, anxious, sad, or stressed sometimes. However, if these feelings do not go away and they interfere with your daily life, get help.

The word microgram is sometimes written with the Greek symbol \u03bc followed by the letter g (\u03bcg).\n\nFolic acid reduces the risk of your baby having a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida.\n\nA neural tube defect is when the fetus's spinal cord (part of the body's nervous system) does not form normally.\n\nYou might be advised to take a higher dose supplement of 5 milligram (5mg) every day.\n\nYou may need to take a 5mg supplement of folic acid if:\n- you or the baby's other biological parent have a neural tube defect\n- you previously had a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect\n- you or the baby's other biological parent have a family history of neural tube defects\n- you have diabetes\n\nYour doctor may also recommend a 5mg supplement if you take certain medicines, such as anti-epilepsy medicine or anti-retroviral medicine for HIV.\n\nTalk to a GP if you think you need a 5mg dose of folic acid, as they can prescribe a higher dose.\n\nYou can get folic acid tablets at pharmacies, or talk to a GP about getting a prescription.\n\nDo not worry if you get pregnant unexpectedly and were not taking a folic acid supplement at the time. Start taking them as soon as you find out, until you're past the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nStop smoking\n\nSmoking during pregnancy has been linked to a variety of health problems, including premature birth, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death, and miscarriage.\n\nQuitting can be hard, no matter how much you want to, but support is available.\n\nNHS Quit Smoking offers free help, support and advice on stopping smoking, including when you're pregnant, and can give you details of local support services.\n\nSmoke from other people's cigarettes can damage your baby, so ask your partner, friends and family not to smoke near you.\n\nCut out alcohol\n\nDo not drink alcohol if you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Alcohol can be passed to your unborn baby.\n\nDrinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to your baby, and the more you drink, the greater the risk.\n\nFind out about alcohol and pregnancy.\n\nKeep to a healthy weight\n\nIf you're overweight, you may have problems getting pregnant and fertility treatment is less likely to work.\n\nBeing overweight (having a BMI over 25) or obese (having a BMI over 30) also raises the risk of some pregnancy problems, such as high blood pressure, deep vein thrombosis, miscarriage, and gestational diabetes.\n\nBefore you get pregnant you can calculate your BMI. But this may not be accurate once you're pregnant, so consult your midwife or doctor.\n\nHaving a healthy diet and doing moderate exercise are advised in pregnancy, and it's important not to gain too much weight.\n\nYou can keep to a healthy weight by having a balanced diet and doing regular exercise.\n\nRead more about exercise in pregnancy.\n\nKnow which medicines you can take\n\nNot all medicines are safe to take when you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, whether they're on prescription or medicines you can buy in a pharmacy or shop.\n\nInformation:\nIf you take prescribed medicine and you're planning to get pregnant, talk to a doctor.\nDo not stop taking your medicine without talking to a doctor.\nFind out about medicines in pregnancy.\n\nVaccinations and infections\n\nSome infections, such as rubella (German measles), can harm your baby if you catch them during pregnancy.\n\nMost people in the UK are immune to rubella, thanks to the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.\n\nIf you have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, or you're not sure if you have, ask your GP surgery to check your vaccination history.\n\nIf you have not had both doses or there's no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP surgery.\n\nYou should avoid getting pregnant for 1 month after having the MMR vaccination, which means you'll need a reliable method of contraception.\n\nTalk to a doctor if you have a long-term condition\n\nIf you have a long-term condition, such as epilepsy or diabetes, it could affect the decisions you make about your pregnancy \u2013 for example, where you might want to give birth.\n\nBefore you get pregnant, have a discussion with your specialist or a GP about getting pregnant.\n\nYou can also talk to your GP if you have a mental health condition and are planning to get pregnant. They may be able to refer you to a specialist mental health team who offer support before, during and after pregnancy.\n\nIf you're taking medicine for a condition, do not stop taking it without talking to a doctor.\n\nTesting for sickle cell and thalassaemia\n\nSickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia are inherited blood disorders that mainly affect people whose ancestors come from Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, India, Pakistan, south and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nIf you are pregnant and live in England you will be offered screening tests for these disorders, but you do not have to wait until you're pregnant before you have a test.\n\nIf you or your partner are concerned you may be a carrier for one of these disorders, perhaps because someone in your family has a blood disorder or is a carrier, it's a good idea to get tested before starting a family.\n\nYou can ask for a free blood test from either a GP or a local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre.\n\nFind out more about screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia in pregnancy.",

        "clean content": "10 Things To Keep In Mind Before Buying A New Car!\n\nFix your Budget\n\nFirstly, we recommend you to determine how much money you are willing to spend on a car. After all, if you are planning to buy your dream car, money is the only thing that could be an obstacle. Here in India, all the car manufacturers tend to give an ex-showroom price for the car to make the deal tempting. Well, one should not forget that two things that drive the prices high are the RTO and insurance. Also, some companies take handling charges. All these combine and make the car a lot more expensive than what it was advertised for.\n\nFuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, or Electric)\n\nWith the budget fixed, comes choosing the type fuel. A buyer in the market can choose from Petrol, diesel, electric or CNG depending upon the use. Let\u2019s dive a bit deeper. With the technology advancements, diesel is almost on the verge of extinction in private vehicles. Neither the fuel prices are very far apart.\n\nIf you travel more than 30kms in a car on daily basis, CNG could be a really good option as it is cheaper to run and even the maintenance is at power with a petrol engine. Thanks to the metro cities and the technology, electric cars are finally a thing here in India.\n\nNow, as the electric cars are on sale for consumers, this could fair a really good deal when it comes to savings. Sure, the upfront cost is more than the cars with a gasoline engine. It\u2019ll be cheaper in the long run.\n\nBody Type\n\nComing to the next aspect, body type. We are sure you\u2019d be knowing all the types but let us give a slight insight. Here in \u2018Indian Market\u2019 there are three body types, based on increasing size, hatchbacks, sedans and SUVs with the smallest, of course, being hatchbacks.\n\nHatchbacks:\n\nHaving parking problems? hatchbacks could be just right for you. These small cute little cars are also less tiring on stop and go city traffic and are easily flickabe. Also, they offer some luxury features.\n\nSedans:\n\nThis is the segment that boasts of elegance and luxury. Along with that, because of the long-wheelbase when compared to the hatches, it opens up more space on the inside. Willing to go on long trips with decent luggage and not compromising on luxury, the sedan is what to go for.\n\nSUV:\n\nThere is no denying the fact that over a decade, the big, tall SUVs have attracted most of the buyers. After all, they offer something that no other segment offers, i.e, go anywhere characteristic. This is what the SUVs do without much compromise in ride comfort. But, earlier the SUVs were all about rugged appeal and off-roading, current-gen SUVs are more of soft-roaders and mostly are designed for the urban jungle.\n\nEngine\n\nComing to the heart of the engine, the question comes, what to see when comparing two cars. Is it the Bhp or the torque? Also, what more confusing is whether to go for a small capacity engine or the one with large displacement. Let me tell you, Bhp or power is what that should have more preference.\n\nHere is why!\n\nWith that out of our way, if you think that a small capacity engine will have better mileage, well, let me tell you, it\u2019s much more than simple maths. An engine with less displacement (say 1.0-litre) will sure consume less fuel in one cycle, but it has to undergo many cycles to extract the most out of the engine.\n\nIn other words, the engine has to be kept on a boil to keep the car running at a decent pace, whereas a large capacity engine will have to do less work hence almost the same fuel will be consumed. This can be solved by turbocharging which is the trend of the 22nd-century cars in India.\n\nTransmission\n\nWell, let\u2019s not waste your time by explaining the type of transmission. But still, if you want to have a look at the types and how they work, knowledge is just a click away.\n\nEverything about\n\nThe stick shift or manual transmission is about to die in the international automotive market but we aren\u2019t in that market. Cars with manual transmission are still a thing here in our domestic automotive market. How can one forget the sheer pleasure and the sense of power when shifting the lever? But choose the manual if you are either tight on budget or do less of inter-city travel.\n\nWhich is the better automatic?\n\nIf you are among the people looking for a subtler and comfortable ride and do a lot of inter-city travel, the automatic transmission is just for you. There are several types of automatic transmission available in the market,this will help you in deciding one. But mind it, an automatic transmission sure is comfortable, it might fare a bit difficult on hilly roads.\n\nSafety Rating\n\nThankfully, the automotive industry is putting the right use of the internet. Better late than never, people looking for cars have the safety rating among the top pointers in their wish lists. After all, who wants their loved ones in danger. Well, no one thought drinking coffee with family was that dangerous.\n\nHere are\n\nOwnership Cost\n\nDeciding a car to buy is tough, what\u2019s even tougher is maintaining the vehicle. In the end, one spends a lot more than what he/she was willing to pay in the maintenance. That said, this factor should not be kept aside, as the value of the car depreciates with time and we tend to put more money on that very same car.\n\nResale Value\n\nThinking re-sale when buying a car is a wise decision which is practised by almost everyone here in India. With that, one might also, calculate the possible resale value after the term of use. This is one of the reasons, Maruti Suzukis and Toyotas have a really good re-sale value. It\u2019s sad to see that the resale value also depends on the car\u2019s manufacturer.\n\nHere are\n\nCreature Comfort\n\nComing to the last point of research, the features and creature comforts. This is something that depends on variants with the top-end trip getting all the bells and whistles that the car has on offer. But the top variants do costs more, so one can look for the features those are necessary like rear defogger and rear wash wiper. These two are some necessary features car makers miss out on the base variant.\n\nTest Drive\n\nIn the end, after shortlisting the car, don\u2019t forget to give the try. Over here, don\u2019t forget to check how the car handles, is it sharp or slick. Also, don\u2019t forget to check the clutch and its weight. And most importantly, if it is your first automatic car, then you ought to take a test ride, well, just in case.",

        "clean content": "5 Tips For Buying A Car The Smart Way\n\nSo you're thinking about buying a car? NPR's Life Kit has your back. Here are the most important things to know so you don't get in over your head or let a car dealer take advantage of you.\n\n1. Get preapproved for a loan before you set foot in a dealer's lot.\n\n\"The single best advice I can give to people is to get preapproved for a car loan from your bank, a credit union or an online lender,\" says Philip Reed. He's the autos editor at the personal finance site NerdWallet. He also worked undercover at an auto dealership to learn the secrets of the business when he worked for the car-buying site Edmunds.com. So Reed is going to pull back the curtain on the car-buying game.\n\nFor one thing, he says, getting a loan from a lender outside the car dealership prompts buyers to think about a crucial question. \"How much car can I afford? You want to do that before a salesperson has you falling in love with the limited model with the sunroof and leather seats. \"Reed says getting preapproved also reveals any problems with your credit. So before you start car shopping, you might want to build up your credit score or get erroneous information off your credit report.\n\nAnd shop around for the best rate. \"People are being charged more for interest rates than they should be based upon their creditworthiness,\" says John Van Alst, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nVan Alst says many people don't realize it, but the dealership is allowed to jack up the rate it offers you above what you actually qualify for. So with your credit score, \"you might qualify for an interest rate of 6%,\" says Van Alst. But, he says, the dealership might not tell you that and offer you a 9% rate.\n\nIf you take that bad deal, you could pay thousands of dollars more in interest. Van Alst says the dealership and its finance company, \"they'll split that extra money.\"\n\nSo Reed says having that preapproval can be a valuable card to have in your hand in the car-buying game. It can help you negotiate a better rate. \"The preapproval will act as a bargaining chip,\" he says. \"If you're preapproved at 4.5%, the dealer says, 'Hey, you know, I can get you 3.5. Would you be interested?' And it's a good idea to take it, but make sure all of the terms, meaning the down payment and the length of the loan, remain the same.\"\n\nOne word of caution about lenders: Van Alst says there are plenty of shady lending outfits operating online. Reed says it's a good idea to go with a mainstream bank, credit union or other lender whose name you recognize.\n\n2. Keep it simple at the dealership.\n\nIf you're buying a car at a dealership, focus on one thing at a time. And don't tell the salespeople too much. Remember \u2014 this is a kind of game. And if you're playing cards, you don't hold them up and say, \"Hey, everybody, look \u2014 I have a pair of queens,\" right?\n\nSo at the dealership, Reed and Van Alst both say, the first step is to start with the price of the vehicle you are buying. The salesperson at the dealership will often want to know if you're planning to trade in another car and whether you're also looking to get a loan through the dealership. Reed says don't answer those questions! That makes the game too complicated, and you're playing against pros. If you negotiate a really good purchase price on the car, they might jack up the interest rate to make extra money on you that way or lowball you on your trade-in. They can juggle all those factors in their head at once. You don't want to. Keep it simple. One thing at a time.\n\nOnce you settle on a price, then you can talk about a trade-in if you have one. But Reed and Van Alst say to do your homework there too. A little research online can tell you what your trade is worth in ballpark terms. Reed suggests looking at the free pricing guides at Edmunds.com, Kelley Blue Book and NADA. On Autotrader, you can also see what people in your area are asking for your car model. And he says, \"You can get an actual offer from Carvana.com and also by taking the car to a CarMax, where they will write you a check on the spot.\"\n\nSo he and Van Alst say don't be afraid to walk away or buy the car at a good price without the trade-in if you feel the dealership is lowballing you on your old car. You have plenty of other good options these days.\n\n3. Don't buy any add-ons at the dealership.\n\nIf you've bought a car, you know how this works. You've been at the dealership for hours, you're tired, you've settled on a price, you've haggled over the trade-in \u2014 then you get handed off to the finance manager.\n\n\"You're led to this back office. They'll often refer to it as the box,\" says Van Alst. This is where the dealership will try to sell you extended warranties, tire protection plans, paint protection plans, something called gap insurance. Dealerships make a lot of money on this stuff. And Van Alst says it's often very overpriced and most people have no idea how to figure out a fair price.\n\n\"Is this add-on, you know, being marked up 300%? You don't really know any of that,\" Van Alst says. So he and Reed say a good strategy, especially with a new car, is to just say no \u2014 to everything. He says especially with longer-term loans, there's more wiggle room for dealers to try to sell you the extras. The finance person might try to tell you, \"It's only a little more money per month.\" But that money adds up.\n\n\"Concerning the extended factory warranty, you can always buy it later,\" says Reed. \"So if you're buying a new car, you can buy it in three years from now, just before it goes out of warranty.\" At that point, if you want the extended warranty, he says, you should call several dealerships and ask for the best price each can offer. That way, he says, you're not rolling the cost into your car loan and paying interest on a service you wouldn't even use for three years because you're still covered by the new car's warranty.\n\nGap insurance promises to cover any gap between the purchase price of replacing your almost-new car with a brand-new car if your regular insurance doesn't pay for full replacement if your car gets totaled. Van Alst says gap insurance is often overpriced and is fundamentally problematic. If you still want the product, it's best to obtain it through your regular insurance company, not the dealer.\n\n4. Beware longer-term six- or seven-year car loans.\n\nA third of new car loans are now longer than six years. And that's \"a really dangerous trend,\" says Reed. We have a whole story about why that's the case. But in short, a seven-year loan will mean lower monthly payments than a five-year loan. But it will also mean paying a lot more money in interest.\n\nReed says seven-year loans often have higher interest rates than five-year loans. And like most loans, the interest is front-loaded \u2014 you're paying more interest compared with principal in the first years. \"Most people don't even realize this, and they don't know why it's dangerous,\" says Reed.\n\nReed says that if you want to sell your car \u2014 you decide you can't afford it, or maybe you have another kid and need a minivan instead \u2014 with a seven-year loan you are much more likely to be stuck still owing more than the car is worth. So he says, \"It puts you in a very vulnerable financial situation.\"\n\nA better way to go, Reed says, is a five-year loan for a new car and \"with a used car you should really finance it for only three years, which is 36 months.\" One reason that makes sense, he says, is that if your used car breaks down and isn't worth fixing \u2014 say the transmission totally goes \u2014 you're more likely to have paid off the loan by that time.\n\nReed says a five-year loan make sense for new cars because \"that's been the traditional way \u2014 it's kind of a sweet spot. The payments aren't too high. You know the car will still be in good condition. There will still be value in the car at the end of the five years.\"\n\nAlso, Van Alst and Reed say to make sure dealers don't slip in extras or change the loan terms without you realizing it. Read carefully what you're signing.\n\nReed says a colleague at NerdWallet actually bought a minivan recently and \"when she got home, she looked at the contract.\" She had asked for a five-year loan but said the dealership instead stuck her with a seven-year loan. \"And they included a factory warranty which she didn't request and she didn't want.\" Reed says she was able to cancel the entire contract, remove the extended warranty and get a rebate on it.\n\n\"But the point of it is,\" he says, \"I mean, here's somebody who is very financially savvy, and yet they were able to do this to her. And it's not an uncommon scenario for people to think that they've got a good deal, but then when they go home and look at the contract, they find out what's been done to them.\"\n\n5. Don't buy too much car. And consider a used car to save a lot of money!\n\n\"The golden rule is that all of your car expenses should really be no more than 20% of your take-home pay,\" says Reed. And he says that that's total car expenses, including insurance, gas and repairs. \"So the car payment itself should be between 10 and 15%.\"\n\nAnd if a new car with a five-year loan doesn't fit into your budget, you might decide you don't really need a brand-new car.\n\n\"We're actually living in a golden age of used cars,\" says Reed. \"I mean, the reliability of used cars is remarkable these days.\" Reed says there is an endless river of cars coming off three-year leases that are in very good shape. And even cars that are older than that, he says, are definitely worth considering. \"You know, people are buying good used cars at a hundred-thousand miles and driving them for another hundred-thousand miles,\" says Reed. \"So I'm a big fan of buying a used car as a way to save money.\"\n\nHe acknowledges that which car you buy matters and that it's a good idea to read reviews and ratings about which brands and models are more or less likely to run into costly repair problems down the road. He says some European cars are famously expensive to maintain.",

        "clean content": "Things to consider before buying a new car\n\nBuying a new car is an exciting experience, whether it\u2019s your first car or an upgrade it can be easy to get caught up in the excitement. Here, we share our tips for what to consider when purchasing a new car.\n\nShould I get a Car Loan?\nBefore heading to a car dealer in your city, it\u2019s a good idea to think about how much you can realistically afford to spend on a new car, and whether a car loan would be appropriate for your circumstances.\n\nA car loan is an option that you could consider to get you into your car and on the road sooner. Depending on your personal circumstances, you can choose to finance 100% of the cost of the car, or a portion of it if you have existing savings that you would like to use. At Westpac, we offer car loans between $10,000 and $100,000 for a new or used car which is used for security for the loan (credit criteria, fees, charges terms and conditions apply).\n\nWestpac has a competitive interest rate for a car loan that uses the car as security for the loan. You should make your own enquiries to see if a personal loan is right for you.\n\nTry out our borrowing power calculator to help you see how much you can comfortably afford.\n\nBrand new or second hand?\nQuite often this question comes down to budget, but there are other considerations when it comes to purchasing a new or second \u2013hand vehicle.\n\nFor example, a brand new or demo car will generally come with a warranty and vehicle servicing support, so if a fault were to arise with the car, as long as it falls within warranty, you might not be too out of pocket. Purchasing a new car also means that you have the option to include the extras that are important to you, such as window tinting or leather seats. The downside of a brand new car is that the value of the vehicle depreciates the minute you drive out of the showroom.\n\nPurchasing a second-hand car may save you money, however it is difficult to truly know the history of the vehicle and how reliable it will be in the long run. One way to limit unforeseen expenses is to get a mechanic to inspect the car beforehand and obtain a safety inspection.\n\nWhat sort of car suits my needs?\nTake a minute to think about exactly what you need from your car. For example, if you\u2019re a tradie with a lot of tools then a convertible may not be the best solution for you. Similarly, if you\u2019re a family of 6 then a minivan or SUV will be a better option than a small hatchback. List out the key features you need your car to have, this will make it much easier to make a decision.\n\nConsider things like:\nThe body type- sedan, hatch, convertible, ute, SUV\nThe transmission- manual or auto\nExtras- Bluetooth connectivity, cruise control, sound system etc.\nDiesel, gas or petrol\n\nHow much will the upkeep cost?\nEvery make and model of car will have a different set of expenses associated with the upkeep. When choosing your car, consider the cost of maintenance such as servicing and tyre replacement. For example, a luxury European import car generally costs more to service and replace parts, than a locally made or imported car.\n\nDo I need car insurance?\nIf you are taking out a car loan that uses your car as security for the loan, you will need to provide details of Comprehensive car insurance (as well as Compulsory Third Party) before the loan is made available. Comprehensive insurance helps cover loss or damage to the car if it\u2019s written off in an accident or it\u2019s stolen. Did you know that Westpac can arrange a comprehensive insurance policy. Policy terms, conditions, limits and exclusions apply, see the Westpac Motor Insurance PDS (PDF 375KB) to see if this insurance is right for you.\n\nDo I need a safety inspection?\nIf you are buying a private second hand car then it may be a good idea to organise an independent safety inspection, just to be sure that the car is roadworthy. A safety inspection can be done by the government road authority in your State or Territory, or you can arrange for a mechanic to inspect the car.\n\nOther expenses to think about\nLastly, keep in mind that there may be other expenses applicable to your new car. For example, these could include:\nStamp duty\nGST\nVehicle registration\nTransfer of ownership\nDealer delivery\nLuxury car tax\nRoadside assistance membership (different in each state)\nRoadworthy certificate\n\nAre you ready to take a step closer to getting a new car?

        "clean content": "Several Factors To Consider When Buying Your Next Car [UPDATED]\n\nBuying a car is usually a pretty big purchase. You will likely be using it for years to come, while you may also be paying for it for a few years. With this in mind, it makes sense to take your time and find the car that is right for and there are various factors to consider when buying a car.\n\nHow Practical Does the Car Need to Be?\nFor many people, the ideal car is a small run-around that will take them to the shops and back. For others, only a large SUV with plenty of add-ons that carries the whole family and equipment will do.\n\nBefore you decide on any vehicle, you will need to consider how you will be using it and how practical you need it to be. Does the vehicle need to be able to drive off-road? What kind of carrying capacity do you need, and do you need something that will provide personal protection and other safety features?\n\nIn many cases, a degree of compromise will be needed, depending on who will use the car. While you might be happy with the type of car that\u2019s ideal for city driving, for example, your partner might want something more comfortable if they\u2019re commuting to work. In such a case, so something like a sports coupe might make a good choice.\n\nDoes it Fit Your Budget?\nBudget is one of the most important factors to consider when buying a car. Of course, we\u2019d all like a top of the range vehicle that offers supreme comfort and performance, but we need to be realistic about what we can afford.\n\nOne way to get the car you want at affordable monthly payments is to consider opting for a used vehicle, often available for significantly lower prices than brand-new cars. In many cases, a used car can be in near-showroom condition and still be available at a discount simply because it had a previous owner.\n\nWhichever you choose, make sure the price of the car doesn\u2019t leave you struggling to pay your bills. In many cases, you will be able to select a less expensive model that still offers similar functionality to your preferred choice.\n\nConsider Electric Vehicles\nMuch of the world is going green, and infrastructure such as charging points is improving. However, there is still some resistance to choosing electric vehicles over gas-powered vehicles. One reason for the resistance is the higher cost of buying an electric car, but you should also consider the low running costs of electric vehicles. Another reason for a reluctance to turn to electricity is range anxiety, meaning people are concerned battery capacity is not sufficient for longer journeys.\n\nElectric vehicle technology is much like any other technology in that it\u2019s constantly evolving. Battery power and capacity are improving, costs are falling, and electric vehicles already boast impressive performance statistics and offer plenty of excitement. So if you are doubtful about whether an electric car has what you need, have another look, and you might be surprised at what\u2019s available now.\n\nCalculate Vehicle Operating Costs\nCars need fuel, whether it\u2019s gas or electric, and fuel efficiency is an important factor. They also need repair and maintenance, taxes and insurance need to be paid, and all the costs combined can result in a vehicle that costs too much money to keep on the road.\n\nAs mentioned above, electric vehicles have lower running costs than gas-powered vehicles, even if they are more expensive to buy. Fuel costs are lower, and fewer moving parts mean that maintenance and repairs are needed less frequently.\n\nThe age of a vehicle will also likely have a bearing on running costs. While an older car is likely to cost less to buy, you may end up having to pay more in the long term to keep it on the road. If you\u2019re considering something exotic, remember that spare parts could be difficult and expensive to come by.\n\nLook into the Vehicle\u2019s Durability\nSome vehicles are less durable than others, with some brands known for breaking down frequently. Durability is a particular concern for off-road vehicles that will regularly take a beating from uneven surfaces.\n\nIf you\u2019re somebody who gets a new car regularly, then durability may not be a concern for you. However, if a car is more of a long-term commitment for you, durability should be higher up in your priorities.\n\nAlthough a more durable vehicle will often be more expensive than less durable options, they will still often represent better value for me. Maintenance and repairs are needed less frequently, and your pride and joy will be with you for many years to come.\n\nResearch the Resale Value\nThe time will come when any vehicle becomes too old and obsolete and needs to be replaced. When the time does come, the resale value of your existing car will help influence which new car you can afford to buy. How much you can sell your old car for will depend on a number of factors, including the age and conditions of the vehicle and the make and model.\n\nToyotas are known for their durability and are among the top performers for resale value. Trucks and SUVs also hold onto their value relatively well, and Porsches tend to have the highest resale value among luxury sports cars.\n\nStudy the Car\u2019s History\nPeople treat their cars differently. For example, some people might use theirs to go shopping at weekends, while others will frequently travel long journeys. In addition, some people will get their vehicle regularly maintained, while others will neglect maintenance and deal with problems as they happen.\n\nChecking out a car\u2019s history will give you a good indicator of its overall condition. If it\u2019s been used a lot, you can expect parts to be worn and potentially need replacement. Likewise, if the vehicle has a poor maintenance record, you\u2019re more likely to experience it. The dealer should be happy to give you full vehicle history report and, if they\u2019re not, it\u2019s probably best to look elsewhere.\n\nConclusion\nMost of the time, buying a car is a pretty big deal, and there are numerous factors to consider when buying a car. It\u2019s important to remember what you need in a car and what\u2019s perfect for one person can be far from ideal for the next. Budget is also a deciding factor for most people, and it\u2019s important to take running costs into account as well as the cost to buy the car, so consider fuel economy and maintenance costs before deciding.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to consider the future use of your car. Do you intend to keep it for long, or do you expect to get a new model in a year or two? How long is a particular car likely to last, and how much will you be able to sell it for when the time comes. You should also ask the car dealership if you can take the vehicle for a test drive so you can get a feel to see if it\u2019s right for you, and get an idea of the condition it\u2019s in.\n\nFor additional resources on car selling, see this guide to the Facebook marketplace.",

        "clean content": "What You Must Know Before Investing in Cryptocurrency\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype. Digital currencies have quickly risen to prominence in the portfolios of many retail and institutional investors. At the same time, analysts have continued to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies. If you\u2019ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it\u2019s important, as with any other investment, to do your research. Below, we\u2019ll explore what you should know before you invest.\n\nConsider Your Motivation\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental question you should ask yourself before making a cryptocurrency investment is why you\u2019re doing it. There are myriad investment vehicles available, many of which offer greater stability and less risk than digital currencies. Are you interested simply because of cryptocurrency\u2019s trendiness? Or is there a more compelling reason for an investment in one or more specific digital tokens? Of course, different investors have various personal investment goals, and exploring the cryptocurrency space may make more sense for some individuals than for others. To start, begin by taking a comprehensive approach of evaluating your personal risk appetite, investment goals, and portfolio diversification. You may be interested in cryptocurrency as an alternative asset to what you already hold. You may also be interested in potentially higher returns with the understanding that this reward comes with potentially higher risks. Before investing in cryptocurrency, gain a personal understanding of what you hope to achieve as this will help set the course for your actions.\n\nSecure Your Keys\n\nIn cryptocurrency, a private key is a secret alphanumeric code that allows a user to access and control their digital assets. In a way, it's basically just the password that grants ownership and control of the funds associated with a specific cryptocurrency address. Anyone who has access to the private keys of an address has access to all of the funds in that address. This is why it's essential to keep private keys secure and never share them with anyone. Private keys are typically generated by a cryptocurrency wallet, and your keys are automatically generated. It's important to note that if a user loses their private key, they'll lose access to their funds forever. Therefore, it's crucial to keep private keys safe and secure by storing them offline in a cold wallet or using a reputable custodial service. In addition, keeping your cryptocurrency on exchanges in a simple way to keep your cryptocurrency liquid and easy to exchange. However, because exchanges technically have access to your keys in this case, you may be more susceptible to losing your funds should the exchange fail or be hacked. Consider solutions to safely storing your private keys such as writing them down using an old fashioned paper and pencil. Your keys are a series of words that are virtually impossible for hackers to guess. Never tell anyone your keys, and store them in a safe location.\n\nGet a Feel for the Industry\n\nIt\u2019s essential for investors\u2014particularly those who are new to digital currencies\u2014to develop a sense of how the digital currency world works before investing. Take time to learn about the different currencies offered. With thousands of different coins and tokens available, it\u2019s crucial to look beyond the biggest names like Bitcoin or Ether. In addition, it\u2019s important to explore blockchain technology to get a sense of how this aspect of the cryptocurrency world works. For example, every blockchain has a consensus protocol to ensure the integrity of the ledger. However, there are different types of consensus protocols. For example, proof-of-work protocols are those that require substantial mining set-ups to validate transactions. Meanwhile, proof-of-stake protocols reward holders with the highest stakes with validation rewards. Understanding different aspects of this may impact your investment. For instance, you may be able to stake your cryptocurrency to generate rewards and increase your holdings. On the other hand, proof-of-stake coins may be inflationary if the rewards given to validators is not closely monitored. You can earn passive income from cryptocurrency via staking rewards.\n\nConsider Hot and Cold Wallets\n\nWhen you buy a cryptocurrency, you can store it in a cold wallet or a hot wallet. The main difference between a hot and cold wallet is their level of security and convenience. Hot wallets are convenient for frequent trading and spending of cryptocurrency but are more vulnerable to hacking and theft. Cold wallets are more secure but less convenient for frequent use. The main difference is the connectivity to the wallet. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and can be accessed easily. Examples of hot wallets include online exchanges, mobile wallets, and software wallets. Though hot wallets are great for ease of transacting, hot wallets are also more vulnerable to hacking and theft. If a hacker gains access to your hot wallet, they can potentially steal all your cryptocurrency holdings. A cold wallet, on the other hand, is not connected to the internet. This type of wallet may be a hardware wallet or paper wallet. Though a cold wallet offers a higher level of security, they are more difficult to transact with. Though they are not vulnerable to online attacks or hacking attempts, it's harder to buy and sell securities from a cold wallet. As you embark on your cryptocurrency journey, consider which wallet makes more sense to you. In many cases, investors have both and store more material values or more valuable cryptocurrency via their cold wallet. Then, any balances they may be willing to lose or wish to play with may be kept on the hot wallet.\n\nRead Cryptocurrency White Papers\n\nMore important than word of mouth, though, are the specifics of a digital currency itself. When you\u2019re considering an investment, take the time to find the project\u2019s white paper. Every cryptocurrency project should have one, and it should be easily accessible (if it\u2019s not, consider that a red flag). Read the white paper carefully; it should tell you everything about what the developers of the project intend for their work, including a time frame, a general overview, and specifics about the project. If the white paper does not contain data and specific details about the project, that is generally seen as a negative. The white paper is a development team\u2019s chance to lay out the who, what, when, and why of their project. If the white paper feels incomplete or misleading, then it might speak to fundamental issues with the project itself. In addition, developers may issue updates to their white paper, especially as it surrounds their development road map. Be wary of projects whose timelines continually shift with minimal progress.\n\nPerform Test Transactions\n\nCryptocurrency is unlike banks in many aspects. One of the most vital reasons to understand this is should you accidentally send money to the wrong place, it may be impossible (literally) to recover. In some cases, you may lose your money forever. As you join the cryptocurrency world, understand the importance of test transactions. Test transactions are an essential step when sending cryptocurrency because they allow you to confirm that the transaction will be successful before sending a significant amount of funds. Though they result in higher fees, they very well may be worth preventing a large error. Test transactions involve sending a small amount of cryptocurrency to a test address. It is meant to simulate a real transaction without actually sending funds to another party. This allows you to test the sending and receiving process, confirm that your wallet is working correctly, and ensure that you have the correct address for the recipient. Once the test transaction has successfully been performed, you can copy the same transaction information for larger exchanges. A test transaction should be a small such as $1.00; once the transaction goes through, you'll know you can send larger amounts.\n\nPatience Is Key\n\nAfter diligent research, you have likely developed a feel for the cryptocurrency industry and may have determined one or more projects in which to invest. The next step is to time your investment. The digital currency world moves quickly and is known for being highly volatile. Remember that digital currencies are highly speculative. For every overnight bitcoin millionaire, many other investors have poured money into the virtual-token realm only to see that money disappear. Investing in this space means taking a risk. By doing your homework before making an investment, you help give yourself the best chance of success.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n\nIs Investing In Cryptocurrency a Good Idea?\n\nWhile analysts caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies, some investors are willing to take the risk for the potential reward. It\u2019s critical to do your research beforehand to determine if investing in cryptocurrency is right for you.\n\nHow Do I Learn More About Crypto I Want To Buy?\n\nTo learn more about cryptocurrencies, join an online community of cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, such as that found on Reddit, to see what the community is discussing. Read the white paper that outlines specific details about the cryptocurrency project that you\u2019re considering. Every project should have an easily accessible white paper\u2014if it\u2019s not, consider that a red flag.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype. Analysts continue to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies. If you\u2019ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it\u2019s important\u2014same as with any other investment\u2014to do your research. Consider why you\u2019re interested in this particular investment vehicle, and familiarize yourself with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, to be more fully equipped to determine whether this type of investment opportunity is worthwhile for you.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

The value of cryptocurrencies soaring up to tens of thousands of dollars for each unit is a great reason for investing in cryptocurrency and trade with it. However, there are many significant concerns you must take care of before investing in crypto.\n\nThe pointers for buying cryptocurrency for the first time can serve as significant support for anyone trying their hand at crypto investments for the first time. However, the different news pieces regarding uncertainty in the value of cryptocurrencies alongside the newly emerging regulations pertaining to cryptocurrencies have been creating doubts about cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs it reasonable to invest in cryptocurrencies? Well, the top benefits of investing in cryptocurrency can show you some valid reasons for adopting them. However, you must be careful when you are investing in crypto for the first time. The following discussion offers you a detailed guide on the top factors you must verify before buying cryptocurrency.\n\nWant to become a Cryptocurrency expert? Enroll now in Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nWhy Should You Buy Cryptocurrency?\n\nMoney has been changing forms for many years, and you can notice that cryptocurrencies are an interesting take on digital money. You have the advantage of blockchain technology with cryptocurrencies in the form of decentralization, encryption, immutability, and transparency.\n\nA first-time cryptocurrency buyer would obviously look for the estimates of value they can get from their investments in cryptocurrencies. For starters, you have the benefit of ownership over a new and unique digital asset that might gain immense value in the future. On top of it, many cryptocurrency coins and tokens are designed with specific utilities in mind.\n\nImportant Points to Know before Buying Cryptocurrency\n\nInvestments in cryptocurrency are more of a trendy thing in the present times. Almost everyone wants a piece of the seemingly tasty cake of cryptocurrencies. However, it is difficult for a first-time crypto buyer to navigate the technicalities of crypto investments. Therefore, you would need a solid guide on the best practices you must follow before you invest in cryptocurrency.\n\n1. Learn about Investing in Crypto\n\nThe first thing you need to know about how to buy cryptocurrency is the overview of mechanisms for purchasing, exchanging, and selling cryptocurrencies. Without an idea of how you should approach crypto investments, you cannot blindly invest your money in cryptocurrencies.\n\nLook for the platforms which help you in depositing and withdrawing fiat currency within a crypto ecosystem. You can explore all the basic steps in the crypto platform, such as the simple purchase and sales options. When you are confident about the processes for buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrencies, you are more likely to make some productive choices.\n\nWant to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Join the Standard & Premium Plans and get free access to Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course.\n\n2. Go For a Balanced Portfolio\n\nThe second important pointer in a beginner\u2019s guide to buy cryptocurrency would obviously focus on creating a diversified and balanced portfolio. You cannot just put all your money on a single crypto coin in the hope that its value will rise. Keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are a highly risky asset in comparison to other investments, particularly due to volatility.\n\nThe pricing of crypto coins has been fluctuating with massive variations in comparatively shorter periods of time. In addition, the important tips for buying cryptocurrency also draw attention to the lack of specific regulations for cryptocurrencies. You don\u2019t have the legal backing of an insurance company to recover your losses in cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the contrary, you can avoid the tribal instinct for getting on board with a popular crypto coin or token. There are many scammers out there as well as staunch evangelists who would go to any height to make you believe in the particular cryptocurrency. As a first-time cryptocurrency buyer, you may develop the urge to invest in a cryptocurrency that seemingly promises a hefty return. However, you don\u2019t have to go through such risks as a first-time investor. On the contrary, you can try spreading your portfolio across various projects in different sectors such as DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and others.\n\nAspiring to Become a Certified NFT Expert? Enroll in Certified NFT Professional (CNFTP) Course Now!\n\n3. Research is Mandatory\n\nThe most prominent addition in any guide on investing in cryptocurrency would obviously point to the limelight on research. Any type of investment requires a good amount of research before you invest the same in an asset. Hours of an endless investigation into the origins of cryptocurrency and its utility can help you understand the value you can get from it.\n\nAt the same time, research also helps you take note of the risks associated with specific cryptocurrencies of your choice. Make sure that you don\u2019t fall for the idea of \u2018someone will buy it at a higher price in the future\u2019 while considering investments in a cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the mandatory additions in tips for buying cryptocurrency, the importance of research is evident in the broad range of information you can access about the cryptocurrency. Look for community forums, online communities as well as crypto developer mailing lists alongside podcasts of crypto professionals. Build your expertise in cryptocurrencies and the related aspects such as economics and cryptography. Clear all your doubts about cryptocurrencies and learn comprehensively about them to judge cryptocurrencies better when it comes to investing.\n\nGet familiar with the terms related to cryptocurrency with Cryptocurrency Flashcards\n\n4. Don\u2019t Join the Herd\n\nOne of the common mistakes of a first-time crypto buyer points to the feeling of missing out on a trend. Many crypto beginners make the mistake of giving in to their \u2018fear of missing out\u2019 only to lose everything. Your instincts can play foul without the support of adequate research, thereby leading to an upset with your investments. If you feel something about a specific cryptocurrency, then the best course of action would be to evaluate the option cautiously. Many failing cryptocurrencies report valuations rising by almost 30% in 24-hour periods for duping unaware beginners.\n\nSo, how to buy cryptocurrency when there are so many hidden complications? The answer points to understanding the complications before they present any problems. Research can help you stay away from any random decisions based on public opinion. You must evaluate the merits and demerits of the cryptocurrency before putting in your hard-earned money.\n\n5. Some Stories are Too Good\n\nKeep in mind that cryptocurrencies rise in value not only on the basis of their utility but also on their perceived utility. The crypto world has many charlatans who would take the first opportunity to weave far-fetched stories about their projects. For example, you must have found many projects which offer the promises of surpassing Bitcoin. Therefore, if a cryptocurrency promises unrealistic benefits, then you must check into it.\n\nA first-time cryptocurrency buyer must take note of specific factors such as underlying mechanisms with crypto platforms. For example, some crypto exchanges can fool you with the opportunity to draw around 99% of your investment as loans while juicing the profits in event of a rise in the value of the coin. On the other hand, you can lose the complete investment if the value of the coin reduces in value.\n\nWant to know the working process and infrastructure of Bitcoin quickly? Check the presentation Now on What Is Bitcoin and How Does It Work\n\n6. Trustless Approach\n\nThe crypto market has become a fertile ground for scammers, despite the promises of cryptographic security. For example, some scammers used Elon Musk\u2019s SNL appearance as a tool for cheating people of $100,000 worth of crypto assets. How did the scammers achieve this? They just put out a \u2018false\u2019 giveaway and showed another important threat to look out for when you buy cryptocurrency or tokens.\n\nThe scammers used a fake Twitter account of Saturday Night Live and asked victims to send small amounts of crypto for address verification. In return, the scammers promised around 10 times the amount return. Quite an attractive and hard-to-ignore value proposition, isn\u2019t it? Therefore, you should try to follow a trustless approach while navigating the crypto domain. Always rely on research and verification as your first course of action when you think of investing in cryptocurrency, as it can help you avoid scams.\n\n7. Avoid the Unit Bias\n\nUnit Bias is basically the assumption that a cryptocurrency trading at $50,000 per unit is better than a coin trading at $1. However, you must shed such assumptions when you think of buying cryptocurrency. With around thousands of cryptocurrencies all over the world, you are likely to explore a broad range of functionalities.\n\nThe tips for buying cryptocurrency would obviously draw attention towards removing \u2018Unit Bias\u2019 as different cryptocurrencies come with varying functionalities. For example, some might have better decentralization, while some can offer improved developer support. Therefore, a deep dive into the technological mechanisms underlying a specific cryptocurrency can speak a lot about its potential.\n\n8. Get the Right Wallet\n\nYou must also pay attention to the choice of a suitable crypto wallet for your cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are basically assets where the holder is considered the rightful owner. So, the concerns regarding how to buy cryptocurrency must also focus on choosing a wallet that can hold the cryptocurrencies safely. However, crypto wallets work by storing private keys to the cryptocurrencies on a blockchain.\n\nWhich type of wallet should you choose as a beginner? The common answer would point at the crypto exchange, which would serve as a cryptocurrency wallet. On the other hand, DeFi solutions have encountered some of the biggest hacks in the course of the last year. Therefore, you should pay adequate attention to choosing a crypto wallet that can safeguard your assets with ease.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains\u2019 Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\n9. Fractional Ownership is a Thing Now\n\nAnother prominent pointer for any first-time cryptocurrency investor would point at the possibilities for fractional ownership of cryptocurrencies. For example, you don\u2019t have to worry about purchasing one complete Bitcoin to establish your crypto ownership. Now, fractional ownership of cryptocurrencies lets you purchase crypto. One of the best examples is that of the small amounts of Dogecoin. As a result, you don\u2019t have to go all-in for specific cryptocurrency investments.\n\n10. Taxation and Regulatory Concerns\n\nThe final highlight in tips for buying cryptocurrency would focus on concerns regarding taxation and regulations. Taxation and regulatory concerns are important, especially in the US, for specific reasons. Similarly, the legal perspectives on cryptocurrencies in different jurisdictions can also play a crucial role in determining the expected returns from crypto investments.\n\nTherefore, you need a clear overview of tax conditions alongside the regulations for crypto in your country or state before investing. Make sure that you don\u2019t violate any law while ensuring proper optimization of your returns on the crypto investment.\n\nStart learning Blockchain with World\u2019s first Blockchain Career Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts Now!\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe discussion regarding pointers on how to buy cryptocurrency basically reflects on the precautions which can help you land good deals. One of the key highlights of investing in cryptocurrency points to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. You have to take on a plausible amount of risk when dealing with cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, the right steps can help you make your way to success with strategically planned investments in cryptocurrencies. Explore the advantages of cryptocurrencies to identify why you should invest in cryptocurrencies in the first place. Subsequently, take note of the best practices for investing your hard-earned money in cryptocurrencies.

The use of gold in trade has been traced as far back as 560 BC to the ancient Kingdom of Lydia. The first modern stock exchange was created over 400 years ago in Amsterdam. Even ETFs have now been traded for over a quarter of a century.\n\nIn contrast, crypto has only been around for a little over a decade. The original decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was first mined in January 2009. While the technology is in many ways revolutionary, the industry is still very new, and the regulatory framework is still evolving. The result is a market that currently experiences substantial volatility, triggered by various factors including crypto exchange bankruptcies and high-profile hacks.\n\nWondering if crypto is right for you? Begin by asking yourself these 4 fundamental questions:\n\n1. Do you understand the crypto landscape and the risks involved with trading?\n\n2. Are you comfortable with the volatility?\n\n3. Do you know how to keep your crypto safe?\n\n4. Do you understand the tax implications?\n\nLet's take a closer look at what to consider for each of these questions.\n\n1. Get educated\n\nWhen you hear about people buying crypto, it might sound like a singular asset like a stock or a bond. It's not. \"Crypto\" encompasses a wide range of investments with varying purposes, including bitcoin, ethereum, and more than 19,000 other cryptocurrencies\u2014many untested and unlikely to survive.\n\nBefore you jump in, get educated on the ins and outs of this fast-growing industry. For example, you should be able to explain the value of blockchain technology and decentralization to friends and family. If you're interested in bitcoin, you should know why concepts like cryptographic hashes and mining are important to its function.\n\nIn addition to the fundamentals, stay up to date on the latest crypto news. It's a fast-paced market, and new developments happen almost daily. Government regulations are also evolving, and each new decision can impact how crypto is treated legally.\n\nOnce you've learned how the technology and economics work, be honest with yourself: Do you truly believe crypto will have value in the long run? If your answer is \"no\" or \"I'm unsure,\" it may not be the right for you. This is an important question because choppy markets may test your conviction.\n\n2. Prepare for volatility\n\nThere are no two ways about it: Crypto currently rides wild price swings. You'll want to ask yourself if you're comfortable with the turbulence before entering the market.\n\nConsider bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Bitcoin's price regularly experiences both double-digit drops and double-digit rallies, sometimes within the same week. If you bought a single bitcoin at $7,000 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, it would have risen to $69,000 in November 2021\u2014a gain of over 850%. But by June 2022, it would have plummeted to $17,500\u2014a price cut of over 70% from its November highs.\n\nEthereum has seen its share of volatility as well. In March 2020, it hovered around $120. It then skyrocketed over 3,900% to $4,867 by November 2021. By June 2022, it had dipped back down to $880.\n\nBeyond these two crypto giants, the volatility can get even more hair-raising. Take the Terra network's token LUNA. Once a widely held cryptocurrency, LUNA saw its price tumble from a high of nearly $120 to functionally zero in May 2022 after its financial underpinnings collapsed. Dogecoin's price history consists of some even more stunning swings, including a gain of over 42,000% from March 2020 to November 2021. By June 2022, it had fallen over 90% from its all-time high.\n\nDespite the 2022 bear market, those who entered the crypto market with a buy-and-hold mentality in 2020 or earlier may still have gains. But many investors have also lost money, or will realize losses down the road. Time will show if cryptocurrency prices become less volatile over time. For the near future, however, prepare for continued volatility.\n\n3. Manage risks\n\nGiven the volatility and uncertainty of trading crypto, it's best to think defensively. While there can be a lot of upside, remember that the downsides can be sudden and sharp. Also note that crypto may have a higher chance of going to zero than many other assets. In light of this, you may want to consider limiting your allocation to an amount you can afford to lose.\n\nIf you're looking to diversify your portfolio or are saving for a particular goal (particularly a short-term goal), crypto may not be an appropriate vehicle due to its unpredictability.\n\nIf you make gains that make crypto a larger part of your portfolio than intended, consider reallocating at least some of those gains to more stable asset classes. This may help iron out some of the unpredictability from your overall holdings.\n\n4. Get smart about security\n\nOne of the most important aspects of buying crypto is keeping it safe. Those who aren't interested in learning the ins and outs of crypto cybersecurity may find it easiest to keep their coins with a trusted custody provider with strong and audited security protocols. These platforms generally have security processes that may be better suited for beginners.\n\nOn the other hand, those looking for a more hands-on approach may choose to custody and secure the asset themselves. This typically involves buying crypto on a crypto trading platform, then transferring holdings to a private digital wallet or physical cold wallet (a USB-like device for crypto storage).\n\nNote that while this route gives you more flexibility with how you use your crypto, there's also no customer service team for those who manage their own security. If your private or exchange accounts are hacked or phished, the crypto trading platform you use goes bankrupt, or you transfer your coins to the wrong wallet address, you may lose access to them forever.\n\n5. Don't forget taxes\n\nOn the surface, crypto is currently taxed a lot like stocks. Holdings sold at a profit trigger the capital gains tax, while those sold at a loss may allow you to take deductions.\n\nHowever, there are also more nuances to consider. For example, paying for goods and services with crypto may also trigger capitals gains or losses. There are also evolving tax rules regarding crypto received for mining or staking, or as part of an airdrop or hard fork.\n\nBecause the industry is so new, tax rules can change rapidly. Consider reviewing the basics on crypto taxes before buying. And while many tax preparation software programs are building crypto calculations into their platforms, you may also want to consult with a tax professional to ensure your filings are accurate.\n\nSumming it up\n\nCrypto is currently an exciting but speculative asset with high volatility. To prepare yourself for the risks, make sure you have assessed its long-term potential before you buy. You may also want to consider limiting your allocation to an amount you can afford to lose.\n\nBe sure to study all your security options before buying. Choosing between storing your coins with a trusted custody provider versus a crypto trading platform could make a big difference when it comes to protecting your assets, especially if you don't have the time to study crypto cybersecurity protocols.\n\nAnd as with all financial holdings, make sure you understand the tax implications. There are more rules for crypto than there are with traditional asset classes, so don't leave room for unwelcome surprises come tax season.\n\nWhen all is said and done, keep risk management at the forefront of your crypto trading strategy. This may help you minimize stress in both the short and long term.\n\nLooking for more ideas and insights?

        "clean content": "7 Things to Know Before Investing in Cryptocurrencies\n\nCrypto offers benefits like financial freedom, but there are also many well-known pitfalls. Here's what every crypto investor should know before entering the market.\n\nRecent events from around the world, ranging from bank accounts being frozen in Canada to economic sanctions due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, have thrust the cryptocurrency market into the spotlight as global economic conditions worsen.\n\nFrom the simple desire to maintain wealth amidst collapsing fiat currencies to finding a reliable way to transfer value across town or across borders, an increasing percentage of the planet's population now find themselves scrambling to learn more about and gain access to crypto that offers protection from the many raging storms.\n\nHere are seven things you should know before investing in the cryptocurrency market:\n\n1. Understand the mechanism of buying, selling and exchanging cryptocurrencies before investing\n\nLocate platforms that allow to both deposit and withdraw local currency as a way to move funds in and out of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Understand how to conduct basic buying and selling trades so that the process will be simple when the time is right.\n\nMainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday purchases is still a work in progress, so the ability to cash out into local currencies will be key to utilising any profits made.\n\n2. A diversified portfolio is key to long-term success\n\nThe urge for tribalism and going all-in on one token is strong in the cryptocurrency market, thanks to multiple factors including die-hard believers and smooth-talking scammers. While stories of half-cent tokens skyrocketing to hundreds of dollars do occasionally occur, the vast majority of projects offer more modest gains or flare out altogether at the first real taste of bear market conditions.\n\nThe safest approach in a risky crypto market is diversifying the portfolio to include top projects in popular sectors like DeFi, NFTs, gaming and layer-one protocols. Once those bases are covered, making smaller bets on possible moonshots is not out of the question, but monitoring position size is key to minimising losses.\n\n3. Do your own research before taking any action\n\nBefore investing, spend a decent amount of time looking deeper into projects to determine if it has long-term sustainability as is actually something you are interested in holding.\n\nNever purchase something just because someone you know (or don't really know) told you to, especially if they are promising guaranteed returns or a risk-free experience. If you hear those things, run for the hills. Crypto is inherently risky and 95% of the tokens that exist today will go to zero over the next decade.\n\n4. Compare the roadmap with developer activity\n\nOne of the great things about open-source technology is the ability for the average person to check out the latest developer activity to get a better read on the progress of a project.\n\nAny project worth taking a deeper dive into will also provide a link to its GitHub repository that allows an up-to-date look at the latest work being done on a project. If the last GitHub entry was months ago but the roadmap says they have major releases coming in the near future, that's usually a red flag that the project might be trying to scam its way to success before rug-pulling unsuspecting bag holders.\n\n5. Timing is everything\n\nDespite the best of intentions, most investing in the crypto community is driven by emotions which can lead to poorly timed investments that result in lost value. When a token starts moving in the market, forces tend to conspire to drive the rally higher, sucking in unsuspecting investors who can't resist the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).\n\nResist the FOMO feeling and wait for the blow-off top and price consolidation if it's a token you absolutely must have. Otherwise, find another solid project that's been trading flat but shows real promise and then ride its wave higher and take profits when the time is right.\n\nIf it's a project you simply want to hold long term, don't let any fear, uncertainty or doubt (FUD) sway you from your resolve.\n\n6. Don't invest more than you can lose\n\nAs mentioned early, cryptocurrencies are inherently risky, most tokens will eventually go to zero. Keeping that in mind, never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nFunds that are put to work in the crypto market should come from what's left after all of life's expenses are taken care of and a little extra has been set aside in case of emergencies. There is no guarantee the value you put into a token will hold in the long term, and even if it does, it can often take years to regain what was lost once a bear market sets in.\n\n7. Keep the long term in mind\n\nMany get involved in cryptocurrency with a mindset on fast riches. Unfortunately, most of them flare out just as quickly as the path is fraught with scams and pitfalls designed to milk desperate people of what little wealth they do have.\n\nIt took a decade for Bitcoin to reach $50,000, and the road was anything but smooth or guaranteed. The same will be true for any token that manages to survive long term with only the most well-informed and steadfast hodler reaping the biggest gains.\n\nFind projects with a real-world use case, a supportive community and a dedicated development team to slowly accumulate over time, keeping in mind the previously-mentioned rules and overarching bull-bear market cycles.\n\nCryptocurrencies and the global adoption of blockchain technology are still in their infancy with decades of growth yet to come. So remember to relax, dial down the FOMO and take a more measured approach to investing in the crypto market in order to ensure your best chance at long-term success.",

        "clean content": "Five things to know before investing in Cryptocurrency\n\nThe volatility of the cryptocurrency market surpasses that of the stock market\n\nOver the last few years, Cryptocurrency has gained widespread acceptance. The interest in Crypto touched new highs, with many start-ups and Crypto exchanges foraying into the space.\n\nThere are currently thousands of Cryptocurrencies available all around the world. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardona, Dogecoin, Tron, and Ripple are just a few of the most well-known digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin is the first and largest virtual currency, accounting for approximately 40% of the total market capitalization of all Cryptocurrencies combined.\n\nHowever, with the increased popularity of the new asset, there are five important things one should know before investing in Cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies are decentralized\n\nCryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to create decentralized networks. Blockchain is an organisational mechanism for ensuring transactional data integrity. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which means they are not controlled or regulated by any government entity. It essentially means that Crypto is a form of digital asset that is based on a network distributed across a large number of computers around the world. Governments and other authorities have no control over them because of their decentralized nature.\n\nSpeculative in nature\n\nSince Cryptocurrencies are still in an evolving stage, several financial experts believe that they will turn out to be a short-lived fad. However, some financial experts believe that Cryptocurrencies will destabilize the current financial system and usher in a new transaction system. It is likely that the majority of Cryptocurrencies will not survive, and a handful of the best ones will. There is a dearth of understanding regarding numerous aspects of Cryptocurrencies, most notably their utility. Some treat it as currency, some use it for payments, others for participating in communities, while the majority regard it as a speculative investment.\n\nHighly volatile\n\nBlockchain-based investments, such as Bitcoin, are inherently volatile and unpredictable due to their speculative nature. Cryptocurrency values are incredibly volatile. They are traded 24/7 around the world, often by anonymous investors who can manipulate the market due to a lack of regulation. There is a lack of information on what drives prices either way. Often, the whiff of regulatory action in any country can drive prices down. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market surpasses that of the stock market. The markets will be shocked if a stock index drops 10%. On Crypto exchanges, though, 10% of moves are virtually everyday events. A rapid rally can bring you money quickly, but a quick drop can wipe you out completely.\n\nSubject to cyber attacks\n\nCryptocurrencies, despite being built on extremely secure blockchain technology, may be vulnerable to cyber security risks. While a blockchain can be secure, the exchanges that play a critical role in boosting the amount of Crypto trading, enabling Bitcoin and other such currencies, do not use the same technology. As a result, they are vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks. Scammers are impersonating or spoofing social media identities in order to deceive consumers into giving them access to their cryptocurrency wallets. There have been a few cases where major Crypto exchanges have been hacked, and many investors have lost their cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nGains from Cryptocurrency taxed\n\nAlthough these virtual online currencies are still unregulated, gains made from them are subject to capital gains tax in many countries. In India as per the Income Tax Act, the Finance Minister announced a 30% tax on earnings on the transfer of virtual digital assets. In the United Kingdom, an individual gaining above their tax allowance will be taxed at 10% up to the basic rate tax band (if available) and 20% on gains at the higher and additional tax rates.",

        "clean content": "7 Essential Things to Know Before Starting a Podcast\n\n1. Know the 'What' and 'Why' from the Beginning\nFirst, it's important to be able to answer the important questions about your podcast before you get started. What is it about? And, probably most importantly, why are you doing it? Beginning a podcast without a defined plan is like starting a journey without a map. You might get there eventually, but you'll waste a lot of time and fuel while you do it.\n\n2. Podcasting Takes a LOT of Planning and Organization\nAs much as it might sound fun to sit in front of a microphone and wax loquacious, take it from me: podcasting is as much about the behind-the-scenes work as it is about recording. For instance, you'll need to create a podcast script before each episode. How detailed you make it is up to you; but in order to make an episode that doesn't need hours of editing, you'll need to go into each recording session with a written plan.\n\n3. Focus on the Value You Bring to Your Audience\nAs a new podcaster, you'll be tempted to keep the podcast focused on yourself. After all, you're the host, right? You might be excited to interview your guest or talk about your topic because you're interested in them. But don't assume something is universally interesting just because you think it is. Why should your audience care? Remind yourself constantly to see your podcast through your audience's eyes.\n\n4. You Don't Need to Spend a Fortune\u2014But You DO Need a Quality Setup\nFor beginner podcasters, it's easy to assume you need a fancy studio with high startup costs in order to produce high-quality content that competes with the big podcasts. Thankfully, though, this isn't necessarily the case. Decide on your priorities (budget, quality video/audio output, ease of use, etc.) and pick a simple setup that meets those priorities.\n\n5. Plan to Manage Your Web Presence\nMany new podcasters assume that since podcasts are an audio medium, you don't need to worry much about visual content. But you should know that you'll need a website if you want to host a successful podcast. Creating your own website lets you employ search engine optimization (SEO) basics to help new listeners find you through Google.\n\n6. You'll Get Bad Feedback\nHere's the bottom line: if you can't handle bad reviews, don't start a podcast. One of the toughest lessons to learn as a new podcaster is that you can't please everyone. Even if you're the greatest content creator who ever lived, there will still be some listeners who just don't resonate with you. And that's okay! Read your reviews and take constructive feedback into account\u2014but don't take nasty messages seriously.\n\n7. It's Not Easy to Make Money as a Podcaster\nOne of the most important things I wish I'd known before starting a podcast is how difficult it is to make an income as a podcaster. In fact, most podcast creators start out with a negative cash flow because they invest money in their equipment and studio setup before starting. Then, it can take a long time to start earning money from sponsorships.\n\nStarting a Podcast: Hard Work, But Extremely Rewarding\nMany podcasting newbies or aspiring podcasters have the wrong idea about what it's like to do the job. Starting a podcast involves in-depth planning and organization, and you always need to keep both your own goals and your audience's needs in mind if you want to create a quality, consistent podcast from the beginning.",

You\u2019ve got topics. You\u2019ve got themes. You\u2019ve got an itch to talk about something you love and starting a podcast is a great way to do just that.\n\nHowever, you shouldn\u2019t start your podcast without thinking about a few important things ahead of time. Even if your show will be only a hobby at first, odds are that you want your show to have the best chance of being successful.\n\nA little planning before you launch can make all the difference between a show that has no listeners, and one that has a massive audience of engaged fans.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the top seven things you need to know before you start your podcast.\n\n1. Know Your Audience, Define Your Niche \ud83c\udfa7\n\nWhat's your topic?\n\nThe first thing everyone is going to ask when you start promoting your podcast is, \u201cWhat is it about?\u201d You need to be crystal clear on the focus of your show if you hope to grow a loyal fan base.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to choose a topic that you already have some knowledge of and/or interest in. Then ask yourself, what unique insight do you have to offer? Before you jump into recording a single episode, understand exactly what your focus is.\n\nAnother important question to ask yourself when starting a podcast is if this a topic that you\u2019ll be able to produce enough content on? Some topics may seem exciting at first, but when you start considering what episodes you could create around them you may realize you need a different topic.\n\nFinally, can you narrow your topic down? It\u2019s important to niche down to something specific, rather than keeping it broad. For example, talking about parenting is fine, but it may be too broad to capture \u2014 and keep \u2014 an audience.\n\nNiche down to something more specific to create the most loyal fanbase.\n\nWhen you niche down your listeners will feel as though you\u2019re talking directly to them. They don\u2019t say \u201cthe riches are in the niches\u201d for nothing! Put another way, the more specific your niche, the easier it will be to create episodes that are perfect for your ideal listener.\n\nFor example, instead of using the broad topic of parenting, niches for this subject could be: parenting children with special needs, parenting without yelling, parenting abroad, managing your own passions while parenting \u2026 you get the idea.\n\nTake a moment to think about your topic now. Is it broad, or is it specific? To help determine whether or not it\u2019s too broad, grab a pad of paper or open a word processing document and start jotting down a list of subtopics related to your current subject.\n\nIf in doing so you see that there are far too many subtopics coming to mind, it may be a sign that you need to get even more specific with the main topic your podcast will be about. On the other hand, if you can\u2019t come up with any additional subtopic ideas, you may need a subject that is slightly broader.\n\nGet Clear on Your Ideal Listener \ud83d\udca1\n\nWho are you talking to? Why? Just like a business owner wants to determine their ideal customer, you need to figure out who that one perfect person is that you want to share your message with.\n\nWhen you consider one perfect person instead of a group of people, it simplifies the process of catering content to them that they would want to listen to. Things to ask yourself as you create your ideal listener persona are:\n\nIs this listener male or female?\nWhat age group do they fall into?\nAre they self-employed, an employee, unemployed, etc.?\nWhat\u2019s their social life like?\nWhat are their hopes, dreams, and challenges?\nWhat would they want to know about the topic of your podcast?\n\nThe more specific you can get here, the better because the answers to these questions could turn into your material for your first several episodes. Which brings us to the next section.\n\n2. Create Episode Subjects \ud83d\udcdd\n\nNow that you\u2019ve narrowed down your focus to a single topic, can you come up with several subjects within your topic to talk about at length?\n\nTry brainstorming a list of episode subjects to make sure there\u2019s enough to say. If you can\u2019t come up with enough material, you may need to choose a broader topic.\n\nTo help you in your brainstorming, think about all the aspects of your topic. If your topic is something like parenting abroad we mentioned earlier, consider all the things your ideal listener might want to know about that.\n\nHere are some examples in this niche to inspire you in brainstorming your own topic:\n\nNiche - Parenting abroad\nSubtopics\nSchooling while living abroad\nSpotlight on different countries \u2013 could make for a multi-episode interview series\nLearning more than one language\nDual citizenships for parents and their children\nBecoming an expat\nMedical care abroad\nVisas and passports\n\nA great place to start when thinking about your episode subjects is looking at books and blogs on the topic. Specifically, look at the table of contents in books on your subject. They are great for inspiration.\n\n3. Pick Your Format and Hosting Style\n\nThere are several formats a podcast can have. Your format might be educational, storytelling (nonfiction or fiction), conversational, or interviews. You can host your podcast yourself, or you can have multiple hosts as well.\n\nPodcasting with friends\n\nA trend we\u2019re seeing these days in the world of podcasting is that people are creating shows with a friend or even a group of friends. What\u2019s great about starting a podcast with friends is not only can you split the startup costs, but it can add a lot of variety to your show too.\n\nHaving multiple personalities that are hosting can add interest and pull in a wide range of listeners. It\u2019s why shows like The View are so popular. Audience members all have their favorite host, and each one brings something different to the table.\n\nPerhaps you have a friend, family member, or even a work colleague that you have a lot in common with. Starting a podcast could be a fabulous way to explore your interests together, and potentially even make some money along the way.\n\nIf you choose to start a podcast with friends, here a few things to consider:\n\nWho will be listed as the show hosts? You could list multiple hosts, or just one \u201cmain\u201d host.\nWhat happens if one of you loses interest? Will you put the show on pause or will you have a rotating guest host?\nHave a plan in place for how you will handle the finances. Include everything from how you will divide the costs to how you will split the profits. If your show starts making money, you\u2019ll be glad you thought of this ahead of time.\nConsider what happens if one of you moves, or you just want to produce the show from your own homes. For this, you\u2019ll need additional equipment and software to record your episodes remotely.\nWho will be in charge of what? One can edit and one can promote, for example. Think about all the tasks involved with producing a podcast, and agree on a plan for how you will divide the work.\n\nPodcasting alone - just you and the mic\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have anyone else on your show to be successful. Your show can be just you sitting in front of a mic telling a story, or teaching your audience something new.\n\nTo host a podcast by yourself, the work will all fall on your shoulders in the beginning. That is unless you have a company backing your show from the outset. You\u2019ll need to come up with all the show ideas, create the content, and then market them.\n\nThis format is wonderful for podcasters who want to dip their toes into the world of podcasting before jumping in with both feet. Then again, fiction and nonfiction storytellers alike can produce dozens of episodes by themselves and grow a rabid fanbase.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f If you decide to use the interview format, think about who you can interview, and create a list of people to reach out to.\n\nIf you want to do an interview-style podcast, make an interview wish list. Think of all the people who might have something to say on your topic, and start compiling their contact information.\n\nBy the way, go big with your interview wish list! You never know who will say yes to you, and the bigger the guest the larger the potential audience you\u2019ll have to promote your show to.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: Four great places to start looking for guests are other podcasts, blogs, YouTube, and HARO.\n\nHARO stands for Help a Reporter Out, and podcast hosts can sign up as a journalist on the platform to seek out guests for their upcoming shows. This is still a largely untapped source for podcasters that isn\u2019t yet saturated with hosts, so it could be a wonderful place to find experts to interview.\n\nNetwork with other podcasters, bloggers, and vloggers to hone in on who the best guests would be for your show. One thing you can do while networking is an attempt to become a guest on other people\u2019s shows. Not only will this help you stay on the radar of other podcast hosts for those moments you\u2019re looking for potential guests, but it\u2019s also a great way to promote your own show.\n\nConsider what subjects they can talk about, and begin designing your show around those subjects. Once you\u2019re up and running, begin contacting and scheduling your interviewees.\n\nA few things to consider if you will be doing a lot of interviews:\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to make sure you have a podcast guest release form (download one for free here) for every guest that will appear on your show. This document will protect you from things like copyright claims, edit and payment demands, potential lawsuits, and more.\n\nIn the beginning, you can probably get away with using a template online, but as your show grows it may be a good idea to consult with an attorney for this and all legal forms related to your podcast.\n\nSchedule interviews well before you plan to launch. It\u2019s no secret that people are busy, and you don\u2019t want to find yourself scrambling to find a guest at the last minute so you can keep up with your posting calendar.\n\nHave a launch date in mind when you start interviewing guests. This doesn\u2019t have to be a firm date, but guests like to know an approximate date as to when their episode will be live.\n\nBatch several interviews at a time so you\u2019ll have plenty of content even if someone backs out or has to reschedule. Besides, when you batch interviews, all your equipment will already be set up giving you the ability to get more done in less time.\n\nIf you can have your guests market your show, it will help you grow your audience faster. Therefore, ask your guests if they will help you promote once their episode is live. Most people are willing to do so, but it helps to put the ask out there ahead of time anyway to keep it top of mind. Then, once the show is live, be sure to give them the tools to make promotion easy.\n\nIf you\u2019re completely new to the interview game, you may also want to practice with friends and family before interviewing a guest for your show. While your first shows may still be cringeworthy, practicing as much as you can prior to recording the real thing never hurt anyone. Even seasoned actors do dress rehearsals and dry runs.\n\n4. Get the Right Equipment \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\nSound quality is critical in a good podcast. If people hear too much background noise or if your voice isn\u2019t crystal clear, they\u2019ll navigate away.\n\nThere are far too many podcast fish in the sea.\n\nYou need to make sure you make it easy for people to listen. While you technically can record a podcast with your computer\u2019s built-in microphone, you\u2019ll get better sound from a high-quality microphone and headphone set.\n\nAdditional podcast equipment you may want to consider includes, but isn\u2019t limited to:\n\nA computer\nPop filter\nBoom stand/microphone stand\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll need to find a podcast host that exactly meets your needs. Believe it or not, to get your podcast episodes on iTunes, Google Podcasts, and other outlets, you\u2019ll need a host for your episodes.\n\nWith RSS.com, all you have to do is upload your audio files via your web browser, and we automatically generate and update your RSS podcast feed.\n\nClick the image to create your podcast RSS feed.\n\n5. Get Recording Software \u23fa\ufe0f\n\nThere are many free and paid options for recording and editing software. Your computer may already have Record It, or if you have a Mac, you have iMovie or GarageBand.\n\nTips for Recording and Editing Your Episodes\n\n- Practice makes perfect\n\nBefore your first interview or recording session, you\u2019ll want to practice with your recording and editing software. Look for tutorials online and learn everything you can about how it works. Then, record practice episodes both alone and with friends or family.\n\nRemember, these practice sessions don\u2019t have to see the light of day. Although it could make for some fun bloopers if you ever want to create an episode like that for your fans. The goal is to get comfortable with speaking and recording, as well as editing. That way when you\u2019re ready for the real thing, it won\u2019t feel as scary.\n\n- Choose a sound-friendly recording location\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that you can clean up your sound in the editing phase, finding a sound-friendly location for recording is better for audio quality. Let\u2019s face it though, odds are unless you have a big budget or a company backing your show, you won\u2019t have a soundproof podcasting studio for recording your first episodes.\n\nChoose the quietest place in your home or office to record your episodes. Some podcasters choose to record in their closets, others under blankets, and others still just try to use a place with minimal background noise and echoes.\n\n- Take your time\n\nBecoming a good podcast host is a marathon, not a sprint. At first, recording and editing may take you a while, and that\u2019s okay. You can worry about speed later. In the beginning, you should focus more on getting it right. Quality over quantity as they say.\n\nAs time goes on and you get familiar with your tools and the act of recording and editing, it will get easier and faster to produce episodes. In fact, at some point, you may even be able to hire help to scale your podcast. But, don\u2019t feel like you have to rush to get to the big leagues.\n\n- Accept that there will be hiccups\n\nIf you go into this knowing that it won\u2019t be smooth in the beginning, you\u2019ll be less likely to get frustrated when things inevitably go awry. It\u2019s important to know that even the most seasoned podcasters have trouble from time to time.\n\nEpisodes accidentally get deleted, guests bail without warning, entire episodes are recorded with the microphone off \u2013 it all happens, and it\u2019s completely normal. When things go wrong, you have two choices \u2013 1. Give up, or 2. Dust yourself off and try again. We sincerely hope you\u2019ll always choose the latter.\n\nIntros, Outros, and a Name - Oh My!\n\nWhile we\u2019re discussing recording, now\u2019s a good time to mention that you should also start thinking about your intro and outro, as well as your podcast\u2019s name.\n\nAn intro is usually a 15 to 30-second audio byte introducing/opening your show. A typical intro will include music and mention the name of the show as well as who the host is. Some hosts choose to use the same intro for every episode, whereas others will change them up by season or even use a new intro with each episode they produce.\n\nThe outro is the show\u2019s wrap-up and indicates to the listener the show is ending. In this segment, you can add a call-to-action, mention your show\u2019s social media handles, or include a website where listeners can learn more about you.\n\nIf you\u2019ll have music in the intro and/or outro segments, you\u2019ll need to find royalty-free music, or create some original pieces. If you\u2019re not using original music, do your homework about the music you\u2019re choosing before adding it to your podcast. Here are a few options for royalty-free music for your podcast:\n\nMubert\nBensound\nPixabay\nIncompetech\nMusopen\nFree Music Archive\nCC Mixter\nVidevo\n\nIt\u2019s important to make sure that whatever music you use is not copyright protected to avoid lawsuits, fines, and having your entire podcast shut down.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name Anyway?\n\nYou might be wondering why you need to think about your name now. As you begin promoting your show and seeking potential guests, not only will they ask you what it\u2019s about, they\u2019ll want to know what it\u2019s called. It\u2019s also a good idea to start building brand awareness as you prepare to launch so that people will already be familiar with it when it comes time to go live.\n\nHaving a name for your show sooner rather than later will help you with other branding decisions you\u2019ll need to make. For example, you\u2019ll need your name in your intro and outro, to purchase a domain name, develop a podcast page on your current website, and to snag up social media handles.\n\nWe cover how to choose a name for your podcast more in-depth here, but a few tips you\u2019ll want to keep in mind include:\n\nUnless your show is based on a geographic location, you might not want to include cities, states, or countries in the name\nUse caution when naming it based on current trends or it might feel obsolete when the trend fades\nDon\u2019t rush to make your name choice, but don\u2019t take too long either\nPodcast names should be easier to remember\n\nFinally, just because you choose a name doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stuck with it forever. You can always create a completely new show under another name later if you really want to.\n\n6. How to Turn Your Recording into a Podcast\n\nOnce you\u2019ve recorded your show, find a host that can store your audio and make it available to your listeners. Your podcast hosting service will walk you through the process, and you can then place your audio files on their website and/or on your own website.\n\nSubmit your podcast to directories\n\nSubmit your show on the most popular directories and get your show in front of millions of potential new listeners and fans.\n\n1. Apple Podcasts: We recommend adding your show to this directory first because it can take the longest to be approved. You\u2019ll need an Apple ID before you can submit your podcast for review.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\n2. Google Podcasts: Once you login with a Gmail account, you can visit the Google Play Podcast Portal, and click the button that says \u201cADD A PODCAST.\u201d Follow the prompts, and then wait for your show to be reviewed. This can take as little as 24 hours, or up to a week.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\n3. Spotify: Create an account, link your RSS feed, and wait for approval. This can take up to five days.\n\nIMPORTANT \u2013 you need to have uploaded at least one episode to your podcast host. Until you do so, Spotify will not be able to find any episodes and will reject your feed.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\n4. Stitcher: Create a content provider profile, click \u201cAdd Show,\u201d add your RSS Feed and show details. Then, submit and wait for approval.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\n5. TuneIn (Also adds your podcast to Amazon Alexa):\n\nGo to their email submission form, fill it out, and hit \u201cSEND EMAIL.\u201d At the risk of sounding like a broken record, you\u2019ll then wait for approval.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\n6. Head on over to the Podcasters page on iHeartRadio.com and click the \u201cSubmit Your Podcast\u201d button. From here, you\u2019ll need to either log in or create an account.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\n7. Pandora For Podcasters. Use your Pandora account to log in and submit your podcast. If you don\u2019t have an account with Pandora, you can register for free here.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\n8. Once you arrive at podcaster.deezer.com, hit the \u201cPublish My Podcast\u201d button. Enter your podcast\u2019s RSS Feed and click the \u201cNEXT\u201d button. At this point, you will receive a confirmation email from Deezer with a verification code.\n\nSubmission Guide\n\nBefore you officially launch, there are a few more things you\u2019ll need\n\nIt\u2019s probably getting exciting now, but you\u2019re still not quite ready to share all of your episodes with the world. Before you can launch, you\u2019ll need:\n\nGraphics for your show: Podcast cover art as well as social media images for Facebook, Twitter, and any other social platforms you choose to promote on\nA description of your show: It should be short and sweet and tell your listeners exactly what your niche is. You\u2019ll use this description when sharing your podcast on all platforms such as iTunes and Google Play.\nA podcasting schedule: Consistency is key to growing a fan base. How frequently will you release your episodes? Will you upload them weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.? Or are you planning on creating seasons and releasing them all at once for people to binge like Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming services do?\nA marketing plan: How will you promote your show? If you have some ideas in place prior to launch, you\u2019ll be that much further ahead of the game once your podcast is live.\n\n7. Manage Your Transcripts\n\nYou\u2019ve recorded and edited your podcast episodes. By now you may have already loaded a few episodes to your media host and shared on iTunes. Next, to make your podcast more accessible and interactive, add your transcripts and show highlights to a dedicated website or page on your existing website for your podcast.\n\nHere\u2019s how to transcribe your podcast for free.\n\nSharing the transcripts and/or show notes helps with SEO, encourages people to share, gives your audience a place to comment, and is also a good place to provide any links to anything you talked about in your show. It\u2019s also a great space to share any affiliate or partner links to products you may have mentioned in your episodes so that your show can start making money even with a small audience.\n\nYou want to always keep your audience in mind and consider how you can make the listening and interacting experience valuable to them. Show notes and transcripts are a great way to give more value to your listeners and get feedback from them as well.\n\nFrom here, your next steps are to keep learning and working on developing and growing your podcast. Record and load more episodes, promote them, schedule more interviews, record and promote as much as you can.\n\nRemember that the more effort you put into your show, the more you will get out of it. Your show has the potential to be a raging success, and RSS.com will be here to help you along the way.\n\n7 Steps to Launch a Podcast Infographic \ud83d\ude80\n\nCopy and paste the code below to share this graphic on your website!\n\nPlease include attribution to https://rss.com with this graphic.\n\nYour Future Podcast Starts Here\n\nReady to launch your own podcast?

        "word count": 2179,
        "clean content": "What to Know Before Starting a Podcast with No Audience\n\nFirst of all, to be most effective, like all things in business, you need to have a strategy for your podcast. So, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What will make your show different?\n- Will you have podcast guests?\n- What\u2019s the purpose of your podcast?\n\nAnd here\u2019s the great part: there\u2019s no absolute right or wrong way to podcast. Well, I mean, podcasting outside while your neighbor mows the lawn might be the absolute wrong way to go about it, but other than that, I think you\u2019re probably safe.\n\nGoing back to what I was saying, there\u2019s no absolute right or wrong way to podcast. If you don\u2019t want to have guests, you don\u2019t have to have guests. If you want to have 10 minute episodes or 80 minute episodes, you can. What matters is that you have a strategy about the content you\u2019re sharing.\n\nSelect a topic that you will love to work on for the long term, and a format that works for you. It could be a weekly solo show on veganism or an interview show on intuitive eating, but define your niche and purpose clearly before you do anything else. If you\u2019re doing an interview-style podcast, create a long list of potential guests.\n\nThink of podcasting like a megaphone. You grow audiences and followers on other platforms and podcasting is no different. However, the experience of choosing to subscribe to a podcast is more like an email newsletter subscription. If your listeners choose to subscribe to your podcast, they get notifications and downloads specifically about your show. There\u2019s a little more weight behind that subscription than just clicking follow on Instagram. It\u2019s unlikely you will be forced to listen to a podcast on a topic that you don\u2019t enjoy. On a platform like Twitter or Facebook, however, you never know when a rant about taxes or politics is going to pop up in your feed.\n\nI chose to start this podcast for a few reasons. To be frank, one of those reasons was that I knew podcasting was growing in popularity, without being too saturated. The data shows that there are 750,000 active podcasts, compared to 23 million YouTube channels and over 600 million blogs. As I wanted to dive deeper into serving the health and fitness niche, I thought a podcast would be a good outlet.\n\nSimilar to YouTube, I love that podcasting allows you to connect with people on a deeper level. It\u2019s easier to convey emotion and tone, maybe even sarcasm, when you can see or hear someone.\n\nAnd speaking of hearing someone, let\u2019s move onto the next thing that you need to know about starting a podcast: the equipment.\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard me talk about the equipment you need for YouTube, you\u2019ll remember that I always say you don\u2019t have to be fancy. You can start a channel with just your iPhone and some natural light from a window. And while you don\u2019t have to be fancy for podcasting either, we do need to put a little effort into the equipment for a podcast.\n\nThe reason we need to invest more into podcasting equipment is because we\u2019re only consuming the content one way \u2013 through our headphones. On YouTube, there\u2019s such a wide variety of production levels, and you consume that content both visually and audibly, so we can excuse the lower production quality a little bit. When it comes to consuming podcast content, we have a lot of high-level content to compare it to \u2013 radio shows, audiobooks, and high-level podcasts like Serial and This American Life.\n\nThe great news is that good quality podcast equipment doesn\u2019t have to be that expensive. Sure, you could go blow a couple thousand dollars if you want to go all-out. But there are reasonable microphones that will sound better than you just using the mic on your Apple headphones. If you remember, at the beginning of this episode, I mentioned my second business, Easy Peasy Studio\u2026 well, we have a whole page of recommended equipment to help you get started. So, hop over to EasyPeasyStudio.com and check it out.\n\nI also want to share one quick hack you can use for improving your audio, especially if your office or room is not carpeted. In a room without carpet, or honestly even a room that just doesn\u2019t have a lot of stuff in it, you have a high chance of your audio sounding really echo-y, which is not great, obviously. So, rather than forking up thousands of dollars to get your room carpeted, there are two things to do: sit closer to the mic, and grab some pillows and a blanket.\n\nSome mics, like the Blue Yeti USB microphone, have different settings that will affect how your podcast sounds. The Blue Yeti, for example, has an omnidirectional mode which means it picks up allllllll the sound around it. Or, the other, better, mode, would be to use the cardioid mode, which only picks up the sounds directly in front of the microphone. Not all mics have these different options, so to help, sitting closer to the mic can help reduce any background noise or echo.\n\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t help, that\u2019s where pillows and blankets can come in handy. Putting pillows or blankets on your desk, right around your mic can help, or if you\u2019re sitting super close to a wall, you could even try propping a pillow up against the wall. Some people also go as far as to podcast with a blanket draped over them and their mic, to make their own miniature sound booth.\n\nLastly, if you are interviewing someone for your podcast, be sure that both of you are wearing headphones, so no echo happens. Doesn\u2019t matter what type of headphones, that won\u2019t affect anything in your recording.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s hard to grow a podcast with no audience.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, there are significantly fewer podcasts than YouTube channels and blogs out there. So, for that reason, it\u2019s easier to potentially grow your podcast, especially if you have a big launch for your podcast and create momentum. And while I said you don\u2019t have to, it does help if you have guests on your show because they (hopefully) share their episode with their audience.\n\nBut speaking of sharing, let\u2019s talk about the hard part of growing a podcast. It\u2019s hard to share a podcast episode. I have friends and family who literally don\u2019t know how to listen to a podcast, and there are probably people in your audience who are the same way. Once people do figure out how to listen, it\u2019s hard to share. People can take a screenshot and post it on their Instagram stories \u2013 which I\u2019d love if you did that right now for this episode \u2013 but it\u2019s basically impossible to share a single episode on your desktop.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s just not that easy to share podcast episodes, which I wish Apple would work on. And that\u2019s why you sharing podcast episodes with your friends and followers is so beneficial for podcast creators. If you want people to do the same for your podcast, why not do it for the podcasts you already listen to?\n\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of what all goes into running a podcast:\n\n- You\u2019ll need to name it and come up with the cover art for it\n- You\u2019ll need to choose a podcast host, and if decide if your podcast will be shared on your website or if it\u2019ll have its own dedicated website\n- You\u2019ll need an interview scheduler, like Calendly or Acuity, if you\u2019re doing interviews\n- You\u2019ll need to decide what equipment and tech you\u2019ll want to use to record your episodes\n- You\u2019ll need to decide whether you\u2019ll be editing your own podcasts or hiring someone to edit for you so you don\u2019t have to mess with it\n- You\u2019ll need to decide if your episodes will have show notes or transcripts\n- And you\u2019ll need to, or should, create graphic templates for you to share your episodes or for your interviewees to share their episodes\n\nOptimizing your podcast when you have no audience.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned before that I also post my podcast episodes on my website, as blog posts. Regardless of whether or not you do that, it\u2019s important to optimize your podcast episode titles to increase the chances of your content pulling up in searches online. I\u2019ve talked about SEO in-depth on here and on my YouTube channel, but just as a refresher, the easiest way to optimize your episode is to think about what people actually search, and to be as specific as possible.\n\nSo for example, instead of just naming your episode, 5 Workout Tips, it would be better as 5 Lower Body Workout Tips for Women. I\u2019m specifying what type of workout and who it\u2019s for. If you are ever discussing something specific like a brand, a supplement, a particular way of eating, a place, etc., that\u2019s important to include in the title as well. You don\u2019t have to make it an overly long title, or keyword stuff it. Just don\u2019t even mess with that.\n\nOnce it\u2019s optimized, you\u2019ll want to be sure that you are driving plenty of traffic to your content. Lots of people share their podcast on Instagram, but I\u2019d also recommend sharing your podcast on LinkedIn as well.\n\nMake sure it\u2019s available on multiple podcast platforms.\n\nI first want to clarify that this does not mean posting your podcasts on YouTube because that\u2019s not effective. But, you should be able to distribute your podcast to multiple platforms like iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, iHeart Radio, etc.\n\nI use Audioboom to host my podcast, and they make it very simple to distribute to all of these platforms, and I\u2019m sure other hosts are similar. Even if I\u2019m not actively listening to podcasts on these other platforms myself, there\u2019s potential for other people to find me there. My podcast is available on a few different platforms, and I really only mention that it\u2019s available on iTunes or Spotify, just to not overwhelm people.\n\nWhile we\u2019re talking about podcast distribution, I think it\u2019s important to also mention social media distribution. It\u2019s not the easiest to share an episode link from iTunes, which is another reason I like to have my podcast episodes on my website \u2013 it\u2019s much easier to share a blog post on social media! So, be sure you\u2019re sharing new podcast episodes on whatever social media platforms you use\u2026 Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Pinterest, or Instagram.\n\nGetting the podcast episodes transcribed.\n\nNow this is not sponsored, but I am a huge fan of using Rev.com.\n\nTo get your podcast episode transcribed with Rev.com, all you have to do is upload the podcast file, pay the $1/minute fee upfront, and then once your order is submitted, you just wait a few hours and your transcript will be in your inbox! You can also include a glossary of terms to help out the person transcribing your podcast if you\u2019re talking about anything with a really weird or complex name. The final transcript will come in a document so you can just download, copy and paste it into your blog post.\n\nAgain, if you listened to last week\u2019s episode, we talked about the SEO benefits of posting videos on your website. Transcribing your podcast episode gives Google more data to index for your website. And, if someone comes to your site and doesn\u2019t love listening to podcasts, they have a blog post to read because of your transcript. Not to mention, you can also use some excerpts from your transcript to create Instagram captions as you share about your episode.\n\nCreate audiograms with Headliner.\n\nThere are a few different apps out there to create audiograms, but Headliner is the app that I use and am familiar with, and I have some tutorials over on my YouTube channel, if you\u2019re interested. (You might also like to hear how YouTube has changed my business!)\n\nAudiograms, to be clear, are the clips you see on Instagram with a still image and audio waves that move as you hear someone speak in the background. The reason I\u2019m bringing these up today is that they are a more dynamic way to share your podcast episode! You can share a clip and give people a sneak peek into the podcast content, and hopefully if it\u2019s a good clip, that will intrigue them enough to go and listen.\n\nWhen people are thinking about starting a podcast, most people think just about their microphone and topics. But, it\u2019s everything that you do after recording that can really make a difference. So just to recap, optimize the title of your episode, share it on multiple platforms, get the episode transcribed, and share audiogram clips on social media. (Be sure to share your episodes when you are on someone else\u2019s podcast, too!)\n\nIf you have any questions about podcasting or content creation, feel free to DM me on Instagram @jesscreatives.",

        "clean content": "10 Considerations When Starting a Podcast\n\n1. Know your audience\nEvery marketing initiative starts with strategy, and that requires you to think of your audience first. If you\u2019re a financial firm speaking to advisors or a B2B firm looking to acquire new business, determine what information would be most interesting and valuable to your customers. Ask yourself some of the following questions:\n- Are there any current trends impacting the industry?\n- What are common questions asked by prospects that my firm can answer?\n- On which topics can I educate my clients?\n\n2. Create compelling content\nCreating compelling content is the foundation of any content marketing strategy. Once you know the questions your audience is asking, that will give you a much better idea of the kind of content to generate. When brainstorming topics, consider a series featuring industry insights or new trends. As you create content that educates, you are elevating your brand as a thought leader.\n\n3. Establish your point of view\nWhile the quality and relevancy of your content is important, be sure to define your niche. What\u2019s going to make your podcast stand out? It\u2019s clear that the podcast landscape is growing and becoming busier, so you need to find a way to pierce through the noise. What\u2019s your point of view that\u2019s not already being expressed by others? Listen to what\u2019s already out there, and find your voice. What can you add that\u2019s new or different?\n\n4. Determine content format\nWhat will be the format of each episode? Will it be a solo podcast, where just one person with expertise talks? Or two co-hosts in a more conversational format? Will you have rotating hosts/experts? Or will you interview guests? Interview podcasts are one of the most popular formats, and if you choose this, keep in mind that you will need to plan a strategy for finding guests and working with others\u2019 schedules.\n\n5. Secure proper equipment\nYou don\u2019t have to have top-of-the-line equipment to create your podcast, but you do need good equipment. No one will listen to your podcast if they can\u2019t hear you well or if the sound quality is poor. And while sound effects such as intro and outro music may not seem like a big deal, they\u2019re important for distinguishing between podcast segments and greatly enhance the overall production quality, so good editing tools are essential.\n\n6. Choose the right platforms\nDeciding where to publish your podcast depends largely on your budget, target audience, and strategy. If your audience is looking for free downloadable media, then a paid service will immediately deter a following. Some services are free to subscribers but cost the company money, and some rates can also grow with the number of subscribers. Make sure you read about the options for where to host and syndicate your podcast before you make a decision.\n\n7. Leverage existing podcast communities for exposure\nAs you begin to launch your podcast, think about what podcast communities you could benefit from getting exposure to their audience. Because having guests on a podcast is such a common practice, there are certainly networks of podcast creators that you can tap into. Building up an audience is one of the hardest parts of starting a podcast, as it can be a slow process at the start. So while compelling content is still important, getting your name out there through other established podcasts can help you get off the ground.\n\n8. Decide the best timeline for you\nAt what frequency will you publish episodes? This could be monthly, bi-monthly, weekly, or more frequently. Figure out what\u2019s going to be consistently workable for you, as consistency is key to building, growing, and maintaining an audience. Keep in mind that you can block out time to record multiple episodes over a couple of days. That way, you build up a library of content ready for release for the next few weeks or months.\n\n9. Define what success will look like for you\nPodcast analytics is still in its infancy. You can\u2019t glean as much information as you can with website analytics, and it\u2019s split between all the different platforms where you publish your podcast, instead of all in one place. Therefore, you should define what success is going to look like for you. Before diving into the whole process, figure out what will make the most sense for you in terms of metrics and monitoring, and then track this to help guide your strategy moving forward.\n\n10. Consider using a professional partner\nWhen you set out to create and manage a podcast, there are a number of critical questions to consider that may not be obvious at the start. How are you going to get the podcast edited? Posted? How will you do the show notes? How will you promote it? There\u2019s a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes of a podcast, from strategy to creative to technical work, and it could be beneficial to bring in a partner to help take off some of that burden. And then you can truly focus on the content, which is your area of expertise!\n\nFine-tune your process\nBefore you launch, be sure to do some test runs. Record actual episodes as tests and understand that they might not make it on the air, as you\u2019re still learning and working out the kinks. Take time to get used to all the equipment, and practice the process of planning, scheduling, writing, and hosting. Then record and store several episodes so that when you launch, you have a number under your belt to help build some momentum as you continue to record. Eventually, you will establish a strong podcast series, and your voice will reach more and more ears!",

        "clean content": "6 Things To Do Before Traveling Internationally\n\nTraveling abroad can be exciting. But there are some things that need to be taken care of if you truly want a stress-free travel. From buying travel insurance to getting vaccinated, there are a number of things that need to be done before you finally fly out to your destination. To help you out, here are 6 things that you must do before traveling to a foreign country.\n\n1. Plan your trip\nPlan the perfect travel itinerary by keeping in mind your budget and your interests. Everyone has different tastes and interests, and having a travel itinerary helps you ensure that the limited time you have is utilized perfectly. The best way to plan your trip is to do a little research on your destination. A simple search on the internet and you will be well aware of the popular sightseeing places and activities that your destination has to offer.\n\n2. Check your passport, visa, and other documents\nBefore you head out on international travel, check your passport for the expiry date. Most of the countries require that the passport be valid for six months after your return. Ensure that you take enough photocopies of your passport\u2019s front page and keep them separately; this will help if your passport gets stolen. Make sure that you have a valid visa for the country you are visiting. Many countries require that you have overseas travel insurance, so make sure that you have one before you apply for a visa. Also, don\u2019t rely on digital copies of your flight tickets and hotel booking. Do keep multiple hard copies of them in safe places.\n\n3. Travel insurance\nWhen traveling abroad, it is important that you buy travel insurance, be it health or baggage protection. Travel insurance covers you in cases of untoward incidents such as a missed or delayed flight or lost baggage. Investing a few hundred rupees now can help you save thousands later.\n\n4. Get yourself vaccinated\nMany countries have stringent vaccination requirements. So, before you apply for a visa, read up if your destination country requires compulsory vaccination for certain diseases. It is also a good idea to get your vaccination up to date, and don\u2019t forget to pack all the essential medicines and supplies. All this will help you avoid medical concerns in a foreign country.\n\n5. Stock up on currency\nYou will definitely need at least some amount of foreign exchange. Exchanging your currency at the airport can be a costly affair as you will need to pay a hefty sum for the exchange. Instead, look around and find better deals as often there are better exchange rates on offer. Also, don\u2019t carry too much cash; opt for one or two international debit cards to take with you. Use them to withdraw money at your destination as ATMs can be found in most places.\n\n6. Pack appropriately\nDo not carry any valuables with you when traveling abroad. Things like jewelry and expensive electronics could attract thieves who target tourists. If you do intend to bring the valuables, always carry them with you and keep them locked in the hotel safe. Also, empty your wallet of unnecessary items, like credit cards that you won\u2019t use. Label each bag with baggage tags that have your name, address, and phone number. If you wear glasses, pack an extra pair.\n\nReading up about the history and customs of your destination countries will benefit you during your stay. Also, learn how to say simple phrases like \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cgood morning\u201d in the local language. Last but definitely not least, ensure that your overseas travel insurance covers the medical condition you might be suffering from. Proper planning and preparation can help you enjoy your trip to the maximum.",

        "clean content": "What Documents Should I Bring When I Travel Abroad?\n\nBefore embarking on international travel, it's important to check the required documentation for your destination. Some countries and territories require visitors to have specific papers in order to pass through immigration. These policies can differ depending on the territory, but you should follow all the standard requirements. Having all your documents in order avoids you being refused entry at border control.\n\nDocuments You May Need When Traveling Abroad\n\nMost destinations will require visitors to have similar paperwork to enter. If you are unsure of what the mandatory documents are, it is recommended that you travel with all of them. You can contact the relevant embassy or consulate to find out more information about what overseas visitors are required to have.\n\nA Valid Passport\n\nFor international travel, a passport is usually required. If you do not already have this travel document, you will need to apply for one in advance before your trip. Always ensure that you allow adequate processing time, as it can often be a lengthy procedure. Your passport usually needs to be valid for at least 6 months from the date you travel. This rule can vary, depending on your destination's immigration policy.\n\nMake Passport Copies\n\nIt is recommended to make copies of the photo page of your passport, in case it is lost or stolen. Always travel with a copy, and keep it separate from your passport.\n\nGet a Visa If Necessary\n\nDepending on the country or territory you are traveling to, you may need a visa to enter. Visa requirements depend on the nationality of the visitor. It is important to check your destination's visa policy before organizing your trip. The most common and convenient way to apply for a visa is through an online visa provider, if this service is available.\n\nCheck whether you need a THC\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments now require visitors to complete a travel health certificate (THC) before arrival. This additional requirement acts as a health declaration for the passenger. It allows the issuing authorities to:\n\n- Monitor who enters and leaves the country\n- Confirm that each passenger meets their specific COVID-19 entry requirements, such as a negative test, vaccination, etc.\n- Easily communicate with visitors if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive\n- Check travelers have booked accommodation if they're required to quarantine\n\nIf this type of document is a mandatory part of your destination's coronavirus policy, you must complete it to be granted access through immigration. Failure to show a completed travel health certificate will result in refused entry.\n\nForeign currency when traveling\n\nWhen traveling abroad, it is recommended that you arrange the relevant currency before reaching your destination. This saves you time as you will not need to organize it once you have arrived. By obtaining the correct currency in advance, you can also save money. You avoid having to use your credit or debit card overseas, which can incur extra fees.\n\nDo I need travel insurance to travel abroad?\n\nIt is usually not mandatory to have travel insurance, although in some countries it is a requirement. It is recommended that all travelers invest in insurance, even if it is not mandatory, to avoid any unexpected costs when abroad. If you have travel insurance, it is important that you carry a copy of your insurance plan details. This makes it much easier if you need to make a claim while you are overseas.\n\nPrinting your flight tickets\n\nAlthough most travelers now manage their flight bookings through a digital device, it is still advisable to carry a paper version too. This avoids the risk of losing access to your digital copy, providing you with a backup solution.\n\nProof of Accommodation to travel\n\nSome countries and territories require all arrivals to provide proof of booked accommodation. This rule has become especially utilized in light of the pandemic. You may need to upload your accommodation details as part of your Travel Health Certificate, as mentioned above. Regardless of your destination's entry requirements, it is recommendable to carry a copy of your booking, as a backup for the digital copy.\n\nCopies of all identification documents\n\nWhen traveling overseas, it is highly advisable to make a copy of all of your identification documents. This covers you in the case of loss or theft, and makes it easier for authorities to identify you.",

        "clean content": "11 Things to Know Before Getting Your First Credit Card\n\nUnderstanding the basics can save you time, money, and aggravation and get you on your way to building good credit.\n\n1. The best credit cards aren't for beginners\nAs a newcomer to credit, you probably won't be able to qualify for the absolute best credit cards - the ones with rich rewards and perks, big sign-up bonuses, or long 0% interest periods. Those cream-of-the-crop products are available only to applicants with good or excellent credit and longer credit histories who meet certain income requirements. You'll likely have to start smaller with your first credit card, with a product geared toward people with limited or no credit history.\n\n2. A security deposit makes a credit card easier to get\nIf you're having trouble getting approved for your first credit card, try a secured credit card. Secured credit cards are designed for people with damaged credit or no credit. To open your account, you'll first need to put down a cash deposit. Your credit limit is typically equal to your deposit. Falling behind on payments could mean losing this deposit. However, if you always make on-time payments and spend well below the card's limit, you could establish good credit within a matter of months.\n\n3. Your first credit card can build your credit - or ruin it\nOne of the main reasons to get your first credit card is to boost your credit. If you're not careful, though, it can have the opposite effect. Every month, your issuer will report your credit card activity to credit bureaus. To make sure your credit card activity helps as much as possible, pay in full and on time every month and stay well below your credit limit.\n\n4. You can see the rates and fees before applying\nCredit card issuers are required by federal law to publicly disclose certain terms, such as interest rates and fees, before you apply. These are displayed in what's called a Schumer box, a table that can usually be found on a credit card's application page online or on a slip enclosed in paper applications.\n\n5. Credit card fees are avoidable\nIt's possible to avoid credit card fees altogether, even if you're new to credit. Plenty of excellent starter cards, including many secured cards, don't charge annual fees. Late fees aren't an issue if you pay on time. Foreign transaction fees are irrelevant if you don't plan on using the card to make charges outside the U.S. The charges associated with balance transfers and cash advances are a moot point if you never make these types of transactions.\n\n6. Interest is completely avoidable, too\nRegardless of how high your credit card APR is, you don't have to pay a dime of interest as long as you pay your credit card bill in full every month. That's because of your card's grace period. However, if you don't pay your bill in full, then not only will you pay interest on that carried balance, but interest will begin accruing on new purchases immediately.\n\n7. You can - and should! - pay more than the minimum\nPaying less than the minimum payment due can lead to an out-of-control balance. It's important to pay more than the minimum to make a dent in your actual credit card debt.\n\n8. Paying late comes at a high cost\nMissing your due date can result in late fees, penalty APRs, and damage to your credit. Consider setting up automatic payments from your bank account or noting your due dates on a calendar as a reminder.\n\n9. Getting too close to your limit can sink your credit score\nThe percentage of available credit you use is called your credit utilization ratio. To keep your score in good shape, try to use less than 30% of your limit at all times.\n\n10. Dealing with credit card fraud isn't as difficult as it sounds\nCredit cards offer more protection against fraud than debit cards do. If your credit card information is used fraudulently, it's the credit card company's money at stake, not yours. You'll have plenty of time to dispute any fraudulent charges, and you don't have to pay.\n\n11. If you're rejected for a credit card, the issuer will tell you why\nCard issuers are required by federal law to send you an explanation for their decision, called an adverse action notice. This feedback could help you decide how to improve your chances for approval next time.",

        "clean content": "Choosing and applying for a credit card\n\nChoosing a credit card\n\nThere are hundreds of credit cards available, so shop around to get the one that suits you best.\n\nStart by thinking about what you want to use the credit card for. This could be to buy things online or on holiday, to pay your bills, or to spread the cost of a purchase. However you choose to use your card, the key thing is whether you will be paying off what you owe every month or spreading repayments over a period.\n\nIf you can pay the balance off in full and on time each month, you can take advantage of the interest-free period. In this case, the interest rate may not be so important, but you may want to look at cards with other incentives like cash back. Even if you think you will be able to pay the balance in full each time, it\u2019s worth planning what you\u2019ll do if you can\u2019t.\n\nIf you want to use the card for borrowing and you won\u2019t be paying off the balance each month, you will usually have to pay interest. In this case, you may want to choose a card with a lower interest rate. Don\u2019t forget to make sure you can afford a regular repayment.\n\nFor more information about how to choose credit, see Getting the best credit deal.\n\nIf you\u2019ve applied for credit cards before\n\nApplying for too many cards or regularly switching cards can affect your credit rating. Each time you make an application, it\u2019s recorded on your credit file. Your file will also show if an application is refused. When new providers check your credit file, it can look like you have lots of cards already or that no one else wants to lend to you.\n\nFind out more about your credit rating and how lenders decide to give you credit.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to pay what you owe on a credit card, find out how to deal with the debt.\n\nChecklist of what to look out for when choosing a credit card\n\nHere\u2019s a checklist of some things to look at when you choose a credit card:\n\n- Annual Percentage Rate (APR). This is the cost of borrowing on the card if you don\u2019t pay the whole balance off each month. You can compare the APR for different cards which will help you to choose the cheapest. You should also compare other things about the cards, for example, fees, charges, and incentives.\n- Minimum repayment. If you don\u2019t pay off the balance each month, you will be asked to repay a minimum amount. This is typically around 3% of the balance due or \u00a35, whichever is higher.\n- Annual fee. Some cards charge a fee each year for use of the card. The fee is added to the amount due and you will have to pay interest on the fee as well as on your spending unless you pay it in full.\n- Charges. Check in the credit agreement what other charges apply to the card. You will usually be charged for going over your credit limit, for using the card abroad, and for late payments.\n- Introductory interest rates. This is where you start off paying a low rate of interest or none at all. The rate then increases after a certain amount of time. For example, it could increase after six months or from a certain date. You\u2019ll often see an introductory rate for balance transfers. If you are comparing cards, look at how long the introductory rate lasts as well as the interest rate it changes to at the end of the introductory period.\n- Loyalty points or rewards. The points add up depending on the amount you spend and you can then use them to buy goods. Sometimes this is in particular shops. Check how and where the rewards can be used and think about how likely you are to use them.\n- Cashback. This is where you get money refunded to your card, depending on how much you spend. Check that you are likely to qualify for the cashback. For example, it may only apply if you pay your balance in full each month. A lower interest rate may be a better deal.\n\nFor more information about APR, see Getting the best credit deal.\n\nComparing cards\n\nKey information you should get\n\nWhen you are given information about a credit card, it should include a summary box with standard key information about the card. This should include the interest-free period, interest rate, and other charges. This is so that you can easily compare different cards.\n\nYou can find more information about the credit card summary box, including an explanation of what all the terms mean, on the UK Cards Association's website.\n\nUsing a comparison website\n\nYou can use a comparison website to see what different credit card providers are offering. This can help you choose the right card for you. There are lots of comparison websites, and not all credit cards will be shown on all sites. So you may need to look around for a particular product.\n\nApplying for a credit card\n\nYou can apply for a credit card:\n\n- Online\n- By post\n- By phone\n- At a bank or building society\n\nYou will have to fill in a form, and the credit card provider will check your credit record with a credit reference agency to see if you are creditworthy.\n\nYour credit record shows information about how you handle your finances, such as your bank account and any other borrowing you have. It tells the provider whether you are a good payer and about any court orders you have had in the last six years. You can check your credit record yourself by contacting one of the credit reference agencies. There is a small fee.\n\nFor more information about your credit file and how to contact the credit reference agencies, see Being refused credit in Credit.\n\nWhen you fill in the application form for a credit card, be careful to make sure all the information you put is correct. If you are not sure about how to complete the form, ask the credit card provider for help. You will have to sign the form to say all the information is correct, and any false information you give may be seen as fraud.\n\nSigning a credit agreement\n\nIf your application is accepted, you will be asked to sign a credit agreement. This is a legal document that sets out what you and the provider are agreeing to. The credit agreement includes details such as how much you can borrow, how much and when to repay, the interest rate and charges that can be added, your rights and responsibilities under the agreement, and any other conditions that apply to it. Always try to read the small print so you know exactly what you are agreeing to.\n\nAdditional cardholders\n\nYou can apply for additional cardholders to have permission to use your card. But remember, if you do this, you are responsible for paying off whatever they spend on your card. It\u2019s a good idea to agree on some rules with any additional cardholders about when they can use the card and make sure they tell you about their spending. Otherwise, you could go over your credit limit or have more to pay off than you expected.\n\nIf your application is refused\n\nProviders don\u2019t have to give you a credit card. Your application may be refused if your credit score is low or you are not a good risk. Ask the provider to tell you which credit reference agency they used if you want to check your credit file.\n\nFor more information about how credit card providers decide whether to give you credit, see Being refused credit in Credit.\n\nAlthough credit card providers can decide not to give you credit, they are not allowed to discriminate against you when they make their decision. This means they aren't allowed to refuse to give you credit just because of your race, sex, disability, religion, sexuality, or where you live.\n\nIf you think you were discriminated against when you applied for a credit card, get advice from an adviser, for example, at a Citizens Advice Bureau.\n\nFurther help and information\n\nFor more information about how to deal with credit cards, see Credit cards.\n\nThe Money Advice Service website has lots of useful information about borrowing and managing your money.\n\nYou can use a comparison website to see what different credit card providers are offering. Here are some examples of comparison websites:\n\n- Which? - www.which.co.uk\n- Moneyfacts - www.moneyfacts.co.uk",

        "clean content": "What to Consider When Choosing a Credit Card\n\nYou're likely constantly inundated with credit card offers. You may even receive several in the mail every single day.\n\nWhile it can be tempting to sign up for every card that you are offered, you should consider several things before applying for a credit card.\n\nDo your research on the credit card company, as well as a specific card's account features, benefits, and any fees. You also need to be sure that you are financially ready to take on the responsibility of a credit card.\n\nCredit cards can be a powerful financial tool if they are handled correctly. However, many people make mistakes with their credit cards such as overspending and end up with credit card debt, so ask yourself the following before signing on the dotted line.\n\nWhy Are You Considering Getting a Credit Card?\n\nIn short, there's only one right answer to this\u2014you're considering opening a credit card to build credit. If this is the case, you need to make sure that you act responsibly with your card. You should pay off the balance in full each month, and not use your credit card for things you otherwise can't afford.\n\nThis means that you continue to stick to your budget. Remember, it may be easy to put that new pair of shoes on your shiny new credit card, but you will eventually have to pay that money back, plus interest.\n\nOther Tips:\n- Limit the number of credit cards that you have.\n- If you are getting a new card because another one is maxed out, you should not get the new credit card. Instead set up a budget and work on paying it off.\n- You could try and get a new credit card to access needed benefits not present in the old one, or try to achieve a lower credit card utilization rate within the billing cycle\n\nLook at the Interest Rate\n\nMany cards will lure you with an introductory interest rate, or APR, of 0%. While this may seem like a great deal at the time, be sure that you can pay off your balance during the promotional period. If not, you'll be forced to pay on your card with the new interest rate, which will probably be higher. It may even jump to 25% or more.\n\nEven if a card is offering a promotional rate, be sure to research the interest rate after the promotional period ends.\n\nShop around and look for the lowest interest rate you qualify for. It will save you money in the long run.\n\nOther tips:\n- In addition to the introductory rate be sure to look at the APR you'll pay after the promotional period is over.\n- The best way to qualify for lower rates is to have a higher credit score, which means you do not utilize too much of your credit and you make your payments on time.\n\nLook for a Card With No Annual Fee\n\nThere are so many credit cards available that you should not pay an annual fee to use your credit card. Many cards try to offer you cash back or other rewards as long as you pay an annual fee with the card. But don't be fooled. There are rewards cards that do not charge an annual fee, so you should keep looking.\n\nOther Tips:\n- Do your research and find a card without an annual fee. A good place to start would be with your current bank or credit union.\n\nConsider the Rewards Offered\n\nIf you are going to pay the entire balance at the end of every month, you should look carefully at the rewards that you can earn by using your credit card. Generally, the best deals are on the cash back cards. These cards return a percentage of your spending to you. You may be able to cash these rewards in for a higher amount on a gift card.\n\nTravel rewards cards are other good options. These cards can earn you points or miles each month to use toward travel, which can save you money.\n\nOther Tips:\n- Take the time to read reviews about the different rewards programs. Sometimes the restrictions on the rewards can make it difficult to use them.\n- Only use rewards cards if you plan to pay off your balance in full each month.\n\nLook at the Penalties\n\nYou should also research and understand the penalties or fees associated with your card. For example, your credit card company can raise your interest rates for one late payment\u2014and that's in addition to a late fee. Surpassing your card balance will also cause a bump in your interest rate.\n\nOther Tips:\n- Understanding how the card works is the best way to make the most of the card without accruing any penalties or additional interest.\n- If one card has high penalties, you might be better off choosing another card.\n\nLimit the Number of Cards You Have\n\nIdeally, you should only have one or two credit cards total, including store credit cards. You do not need more than this. It is too easy to find yourself completely overwhelmed with debt if you have more than one credit card.\n\nThe safest practice is to have just one credit card that you pay off entirely each month, especially if you are just getting started with using credit cards. If you feel like you need an additional card, consider taking out a prepaid credit card that does not charge a monthly fee or expires.\n\nOther Tips:\n- Choose just one or two credit cards that you use. This can stop you from accruing too much credit card debt and help to keep your debt-to-income ratio in check.\n- Avoid using store credit cards, which usually have extremely high interest rates.",

        "clean content": "Four key things to know before getting your first credit card\n\nAre you ready to apply for a credit card but aren't too sure where to start? You're in the right place. Having a credit card can be beneficial when used correctly, so it's key to do your research before choosing the right one and applying.\n\nFour key things to know before getting your first credit card include:\n\nKnowing what credit is and how it works\nUnderstanding how a credit card can help you build credit\nEstablishing what you should know about your credit history\nUnderstanding key terms when researching cards\n\n1. What is credit and how does it work?\nIf you're looking to learn more about credit cards before applying for one, let's start with defining credit itself. We all hear it, but do we really know what the term means?\n\nIn simplest terms, credit is the ability to borrow money and make purchases under an agreement. Within this contractual agreement, you're required to pay back the amount at a particular time. The borrower receives money from an institution, usually a bank, with an agreement to pay the money back. This money will typically carry interest which will need to be paid. This is the cost of borrowing from the institution.\n\nCredit is commonly mentioned when referring to your credit history \u2014 a standing record of your credit usage. Lenders examine your credit history, as well as several other factors, to determine whether you're eligible for different types of loans. Some examples of these loans may be a mortgage, auto loan or credit card. The higher your credit score, the better your terms may be for these services. If you want to improve your chances of getting approved, you'll want to have a good credit history.\n\nBuilding and having good credit is a key part of establishing your financial security. Credit is important not only when it comes to getting approved for a loan, but also when it comes to finding a job, an apartment, getting a car and more.\n\n2. How does a credit card help me build credit?\nCredit cards can be one of the most powerful financial tools when it comes to building your credit. But how does it help you build credit?\n\nUsing a credit card regularly, making payments on time and keeping a low credit utilization can show that you're capable of managing your credit on a regular basis. Simply having an open account can help you build credit. This is because the length of your credit history is one of the factors used to calculate your credit score. Credit card issuers will report your account and activity to the credit bureaus (Experian\u2122, TransUnion\u00ae and Equifax\u00ae), where your credit report is using your information.\n\nTo build your credit with a credit card, you'll need to open an account of your own or become an authorized user on someone else's card. Some ways to build credit include:\n\nMake purchases and pay on time:\nShowing creditors that you're capable of handling debt and showing that you can make payments on time is an essential part of building credit. Making purchases and paying off your balance every month is a good way to increase your credit score. It's a good idea to pay as soon as you receive your statement, so you don't have to worry about missing your due date or incurring interest or fees. Your payment history makes up a significant percentage of your credit score, so paying on time is one of the best ways to build your credit.\n\nBecome an authorized user:\nWhether you're too young to get a credit card of your own or you just haven't had any luck in doing so, you can become an authorized user. An authorized user is permitted to use another person's credit card, as long as the cardmember signed off on it. The authorized user gets a card in their name that's linked to the original cardmember's account. You don't need any credit to become an authorized user, but you can start to build a positive credit history once the bank sees that payments are being made. Keep in mind, not all credit card issuers report authorized user activity, which may not help build credit in this case.\n\nGet a co-signer:\nIf you're trying to increase your chances of approval for a credit card when you don't have the best credit, you can have an individual co-sign for you. This cosigner will need to have established strong credit to help you. Keep in mind that any missed payments on your part will also impact the credit score of the cosigner. Not all credit card issuers offer cosigners.\n\n3. What to know about your credit history\nAlong with credit comes your credit history. This measures your ability to repay debts and how responsible you are when it comes to paying them off on time. Your credit history is recorded in your credit report, which will show how many and what type of credit accounts you have open, the duration of the accounts, amounts owed, the amount of available credit used, if your payments are on time and the number of inquiries. It'll also contain information about any bankruptcies, collections and more.\n\nYou have access to your credit history through a credit report and are eligible for one free report from each credit bureau on an annual basis. You may not have much credit history if you're just starting out. The sooner you start to build credit and credit history, the sooner you'll become more financially secure.\n\nThe information in your credit history is used by potential creditors to decide whether they should extend credit to you and is also used to calculate your credit score. Having a good credit history may make it easier to get credit cards and can make you look like a responsible card member.\n\n4. Helpful terms to know\nWhen starting the process of applying for your first credit card, it helps to study the lingo that comes along with it. Here are some common credit card related terms you may run into and what they mean:\n\nAnnual fee\nAn annual fee is like a yearly membership \u2014 a charge assessed on some business and consumer card accounts for keeping an account open. The fee helps cover the cost of delivering services and benefits.\n\nAnnual percentage rate (Purchase APR)\nThe annual percentage rate (APR), indicated in your cardmember agreement, is the rate of interest charged to your account annually for purchase transactions. It's also referred to as the Purchase APR. Your APR helps calculate the interest charges assessed on the outstanding purchase balance on your account.\n\nCredit limit\nA credit limit or credit access line designates the maximum amount of money the card issuer has agreed to loan to you at any one time. If your balance exceeds the limit, this is referred to as being over-limit.\n\nInterest charges\nInterest charges refer to one type of finance charge, which accrue on an account because of a revolving balance that is subject to an interest rate. Interest charges are the amount assessed for allowing you to pay a portion of the balance, rather than pay the account in full immediately. Different interest rates may be applied to your account depending on the type of transactions made. Some interest charges may begin to accumulate starting the day the transaction is made.\n\nLate fee\nIf you're behind on a payment, you may receive a fee for your bill being late or if you pay less than the minimum payment.\n\nMinimum payment\nThe minimum payment due is the minimum amount that must be paid to keep your account current. If you make only the minimum payment each period, you'll pay more in interest, and it'll take you longer to pay off your balance.\n\nPayment due date\nPayments are due on the date shown on your monthly billing statement. Your payment must be received by your credit card company on this date to avoid being past due. Missing your payment due date can result in fees and can hurt your credit score.\n\nStatement\nYour billing statement is a document generated each month during which there is a balance and/or activity on your account. The statement itemizes the activity (e.g., purchases, fees, interest and payments) which occurred on the account during the billing cycle. The statement also indicates your new balance, minimum payment due and payment due date. On the back of the statement is a description of interest charge calculations, a summarized description of certain account terms, including your billing rights.\n\nNow that you know the four things you need to know before opening your first credit card, you can explore different options and find the best one for your needs.",

        "clean content": "What to look out for when applying for your first credit card\n\nBefore you apply for your first credit card, consider these important factors and read over our top picks to get you started.\n\nWhether you're at the ripe age of 18 (the minimum age required to get a credit card) or in your late twenties just beginning your credit journey, there are a handful of tips for credit newbies.\n\nThough these pieces of advice \u2014 like paying your bill on time and in full, using up very little of your credit limit and constantly reviewing your credit card charges \u2014 are all important notes to make, there are some factors to consider before you ever even swipe your first card.\n\nBelow, Select reviews what you should look out for when applying for your first credit card and top credit cards to help you get started.\n\nWhat to look out for when applying for your first credit card\n\nIt's important to start good credit behavior early, which means making sure your first credit card is affordable.\n\nFirst-time cardholders should shop around before they apply and look out for what interest rates and fees (such as annual fees and foreign transaction fees) that banks and credit card issuers charge. Though you only pay interest on a credit card if you carry a balance, it's important to know ahead of time what you could be getting yourself into before it's too late.\n\nCredit card interest rates are notoriously high \u2014 the average APR being 16.61%, according to the Federal Reserve's most recent data. With many cards charging compound interest on outstanding balances, this could really eat away at any person's finances.\n\nSince credit card issuers are required by law to disclose interest rates and fee information on their website, the good news is that this information is not hard to find.\n\nKeep in mind that each time you apply for a credit card and a lender checks your credit, a hard inquiry shows up on your credit report and dings your credit score a few points temporarily. It's therefore worth doing your homework beforehand so that you reserve your hard inquiries for only the cards you actually want and can afford.\n\nTop credit cards to help you get started\n\nWhile many credit cards exist for beginners, it's important to note that you likely won't have a high credit limit when you just start out.\n\nThis is because a lot of the credit cards that you'll be able to qualify for with very little credit history are secured credit cards. These cards differ from traditional (unsecured) credit cards in that they typically require cardholders to make a security deposit upfront (usually around $200) that acts as your credit limit. For the bank, this deposit acts as collateral in case you don't pay your bills each month. Some of the best secured cards include the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card for a low deposit requirement (see rates and fees) and the Citi\u00ae Secured Mastercard\u00ae for low interest from a major bank.\n\nBut not all credit cards for building credit are secured cards or require the means to put down a security deposit.\n\nThe Petal\u00ae 2 \"Cash Back, No Fees\" Visa\u00ae Credit Card is a great option for applicants with no credit history at all (if you do have a credit score, it will be reviewed and considered as part of the application process) and the Deserve Digital First Card\u2122 is perfect for international applicants since you don't have to be a U.S. citizen to qualify.\n\nFor those with average credit, the Capital One Platinum Credit Card (see rates and fees) allows you to access a higher credit limit after making your first five monthly payments on time. For this reason, it can be a good starter card if you want to eventually upgrade to another card in the Capital One family, such as the Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card (See rates and fees) for earning unlimited 3% cash back on dining and entertainment expenses or the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card (See rates and fees) for earning unlimited 1.25 miles per dollar on every purchase.\n\nAnd for those currently enrolled in school or planning to go back, college student credit cards are a smart choice for students looking to establish credit. The Citi Rewards+\u2120 Student Card is best for making small purchases and supermarket shopping, while the Deserve\u00ae EDU Mastercard for Students is best for international students with no credit history.\n\nThinking ahead\n\nOnce you have shopped around and found the best first credit card for you, remember that your oldest card is the most important to hold onto.\n\nAs you work your way toward a better credit score and graduate to a regular credit card, keep your first one and use it a couple times a year so that you maintain your long credit history; the average length of time you've had credit makes up 15% of your credit score.\n\nInformation about the Deserve\u00ae EDU Mastercard for Students, Citi Rewards+\u2120 Student Card, Deserve Digital First Card\u2122 has been collected independently by Select and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of the card prior to publication.\n\nPetal 2 Visa Credit Card issued by WebBank.\n\nEditorial Note: Opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the Select editorial staff\u2019s alone, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any third party.\n\nLearn More\nTerms Apply\nEarn more with a high yield savings account\nFed rate hikes can mean higher rates on savings accounts\nLearn More\nTerms Apply\nFind the best credit card for you\nLooking for a card that offers cash back or travel rewards?

Getting a tattoo is a big decision for you and especially for your body. It's one decision that will stay with you for years and years. If you want to get inked and don't regret it later, then here are eight things you need to consider before getting a tattoo. From the pain to design, this guide will help you to understand everything about this body art:\n\n1. Expect to be waitlisted\nWalk-ins to a popular tattoo parlour are a rarity, as the famous studios usually have a waiting list. It's a good idea to read reviews and ask for people who have got their tattoo done from a particular parlour you have in mind. If you have zeroed in on an artist, book your appointment.\n\n2. Tattoos are expensive\nA cheap tattoo isn't necessarily a good spend \u2013 and a good tat will never be cheap. The price of a tattoo depends on factors like the size, the area it'll be inked on, the ink used, and the artist.\n\n3. Do a recce of the shop\nLook for things like cleanliness in the shop, the artwork on the wall if that's your aesthetic. While at it, ask for pricing and other doubts before taking the studio into consideration.\n\n4. Consult your dermatologist\nCheck with your dermatologist once and especially if you're prone to skin allergies.\n\n5. Proofread\nYou don't want a tattoo with a word spelled wrong \u2013 it can happen. That's an uncalled for disaster. Always proofread.\n\n6. Getting inked hurts\nThis is a no-brainer but getting inked really hurts. People assume that it is just a pin prick but those who have had tattoos would tell you that it is a lot more. And also some areas hurt more than others.\n\n7. Tattoos do need touch-ups\nAfter getting a tattoo, you might need a few touch-ups in the first months to stabilize the color density and in a couple of months if the color starts to fade away.\n\n8. Post-tattoo care is crucial\nIf you want to avoid infections, how you care for your tattoo is what is crucial. There will be a list of rules that your tattoo artist will give you \u2013 follow them.",

        "clean content": "11 Pieces of Advice on Getting Your First Tattoo, From People Who Have Tattoos\n\n\n\n1. After care is key.\n\n\"Keeping it clean after it's done can be a pain in the ass but it's so, so important. An infection can get very, very serious if left untreated. And, of course, keep it out of the sun\u2014UV rays degrade and fade the ink.\"\n\n\n\n2. Bring a friend.\n\n\"Make sure you have a buddy that can hold your hand and look at it while it's happening. Chew gum. It helps take away the pain.\"\n\n\n\n3. Do your homework.\n\n\"Make sure to do your homework on reputable shops and artists, and be willing to pay a pretty penny for a pretty tattoo. Overall, just have fun with it and make it YOURS. Tattoos are a personal and beautiful thing!\"\n\n\n\n4. Take your time.\n\n\"Take your time. Think about things that are meaningful to you, words of wisdom, people that inspire you, or even a piece of art that speaks to you! But also, have fun with it! Don\u2019t let anyone decide what a \u2018good tattoo\u2019 is. It\u2019s a personal decision, and just like with your clothes or makeup, it\u2019s a form of self-expression. And please, please do your research on the tattoo parlor you want to get yours done at. You do not want a bad parlor experience to ruin tattoos for you!\"\n\n\n\n5. You get what you pay for.\n\n\"RESEARCH YOUR TATTOO SHOP! Let me reiterate: You have this tattoo for the rest of your life. You pay for what you get. Don\u2019t be daunted when they tell you what the minimum is for a tattoo\u2014that can really indicate how good it will turn out. The minimum is really the price of the ink itself, and having been to another shop where the minimum was much less, I can say that I would rather save up and have an $80 charge (before labor and tip) than a crappy tattoo where the ink is splotchy and faded.\"\n\n\n\n6. Remember, it\u2019s a personal choice.\n\n\"I think the most important thing to consider when getting a tattoo (and this is extremely clich\u00e9 but nonetheless true) is that you\u2019ll have that ink on your body for the rest of your life. The art doesn\u2019t have to be grand or have a captivating story behind it; I am a huge supporter of getting tattooed for the present memory itself. Getting tattooed is solely a personal choice\u2014yours and no one else\u2019s. That being said, be sure that it is your choice and you are 100 percent committed to that tattoo.\"\n\n\n\n7. Make sure you feel comfortable.\n\n\"You need to feel comfortable in the tattoo shop that you are planning to go to as well as be comfortable with the person who is giving you that tattoo. The place that I went made me feel comfortable and worked with me to make sure that I was getting exactly what I wanted. If the atmosphere of the shop is making you uneasy, then I would suggest looking elsewhere.\"\n\n\n\n8. Eat before you go. (And tip at the end!)\n\n\"Definitely eat something before you go. I almost passed out AND threw up because I hadn\u2019t eaten anything that day, with just this tiny tattoo. And always, always tip the artist!\"\n\n\n\n9. Start small.\n\n\"I would say go with what your heart tells you and to also start small. This piece of art will be on your body for the rest of your life. Make sure you're happy with the design beforehand and have added your own flare. I have two smaller tattoos that I got previously and it really helped prepare me for this larger one.\"\n\n\n\n10. Think carefully about placement.\n\n\"To anyone who says that it won\u2019t hurt, they\u2019re lying. It\u2019s a needle being poked into you a bunch. What do you expect? But it\u2019s not the sensation of someone impaling you, so in the long run, the pain is worth the product. With that statement, you get what you pay for. Expect to pay more than what you\u2019d expect, and sit down with your artist to see what would be appropriate. Lastly, be 10,000 percent sure of what you want to get, where you get it, and how it may affect you in the future. I get LOTS of comments on this tattoo because it\u2019s on my forearm. Remember, everyone has their own opinions and enjoys different styles of art. Respect what people put on their body, because it\u2019s theirs!\"\n\n\n\n11. Ask others for advice.\n\n\"My parents took me when I turned of age for my first tattoo. They wanted me to see what a clean shop was, learn what questions to ask, and not be afraid to say, \u2018No I want it to look more like this.\u2019 My mom told me to get it in a place where I can hide it or show it off when I want. Now that I\u2019m a teacher, that was really great advice!\"\n\n",

        "clean content": "Getting a Tattoo: What to Expect, Pain Tips, Checklist, and Aftercare\n\nMost tattoos have a story. Your artist can create a touching tribute to a loved one or illustrate an inside joke you have with your friends \u2014 but underlying meaning is never a requirement to getting inked.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is that you walk away from your session happy with the art that\u2019s permanently etched into your skin. And whether it\u2019s your first or fifth time, this feeling is never a guarantee when you\u2019re considering a new tattoo.\n\nBut there are steps you can take to ensure that you walk away loving your new artwork and that it\u2019s healthy. We\u2019ve rounded up everything you need to know to make your experience as easy, painless, and regret-free as possible.\n\nWhat to know before you head to the shop\n\nAbove all else, you have to know what imagery you want. Do you want something floral? A portrait? Abstract blots of color? Or maybe you just want some simple script?\n\nIt\u2019s important to have your core idea fleshed out before setting up a consultation \u2014 unless you\u2019re coming in for lettering, which often only requires you to decide on a font. During the consultation, your artist can work out the finer details. You can show them any images you\u2019ve saved as inspiration and figure out placement and pricing.\n\nDepending on the time they have available, the artist may create a mock-up of your tattoo on the spot or a few days later, but ultimately, the final results will depend on several factors:\n\n- how much of your body you want to dedicate to the art\n- how feasible the tattoo placement is\n- how well the colors you want will show up on your skin tone\n- how much time you want to spend with the artist\n\nHere\u2019s more on what you should consider when designing your next tattoo:\n\nStyle\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what you want tattooed, you have to figure out how you want it to look. There are a ton of different tattooing styles, and you\u2019ll want to go to an artist who\u2019s skilled in the look you\u2019re after.\n\nSome of the most popular styles include:\n\n- American traditional. Characterized by clean, black outlines and the primary color palette, this style commonly features skulls and roses.\n- Traditional Japanese. Inspired by traditional Japanese artwork, this style\u2019s clean lines and minimal shading are often used to create tigers, koi fish, and flowers.\n- Realism. The goal of this style is to recreate subjects using shading and color contrast, as they appear in real life.\n- Illustrative. By combining aspects of traditional tattooing and realism, this style is about bold outlines and intense color saturation.\n- Neo-traditional. A modernized take on American traditional imagery, this style leans heavily on shading and color to create realistic portraiture.\n- Minimalism or geometric. With a focus on crisp black lines and negative space, this style is about precision. The results are often simple and symbolic.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to be familiar with the lingo to get one of these styles. Browsing Instagram is incredibly helpful, as most artists post their work on their own channel and to a hashtag feed. If, for example, you\u2019ve decided you want to get a tattoo of a cat, a quick #cattattoo search pulls up over 220,000 results.\n\nSave the images you like most and show them to your artist during your consultation. They can use these as inspiration to create a one-of-a-kind piece of your own.\n\nDesign\n\nMany people opt for pure illustration, but if you want script \u2014 standalone or alongside an image \u2014 you\u2019ll need to figure out what kind of font you want.\n\nAdobe Typekit is a great place to look up font styles, offering everything from handwriting to typewriter. The site even lets you see your text of choice in the font you\u2019re considering so that you can actually visualize how it might look on your body.\n\nIf you see something you like, print out a couple of different versions to bring to your artist. They may not have your exact font on their computer, so they can use these pages as a reference.\n\nColor\n\nAlthough the style of tattoo often dictates the color palette, the artist can work with you to modify the design and style to better suit what you want.\n\nThat said, your skin tone plays a big role in how well individual colors will hold. For example, fair skin tends to hold white ink better than other skin tones. Red and purple pigments are also more vibrant on fairer skin tones.\n\nDarker skin tones typically hold darker colors \u2014 think crimson red and royal blue \u2014 better than lighter hues. Having darker skin doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t get pastels or other light hues, just that these options usually don\u2019t appear as pigmented as darker colors might.\n\nGreyscale is also an option. With this style, your artist will use a mix of pure black, watered-down black, and white ink to create the appropriate shades and hues.\n\nTattoo color guide\n\n- Lighter colors show up brighter on fairer skin tones, especially white, purple, and red.\n- Richer colors hold better on darker skin tones than pastel colors.\n- All colors will fade over time.\n\nRemember, all colors \u2014 including black \u2014 will fade over time. You can search online for examples of tattoo appearance over time to get an idea of how yours may look one to five years from now.\n\nSize and location\n\nSpeaking of fading, outlines and shapes may look sharp and slick at first, but over time, these can fade or even blur. It all depends on the size and location of your tattoo. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to think about where you want your tattoo and how visible you want it to be.\n\nOften, location alone can determine your tattoo size. After all, there\u2019s only so much space on your forearm or your thigh.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re still second guessing the finer details. Your artist can help you weigh the pros and cons of the location and sizing, as well as set expectations for how it\u2019ll feel when you\u2019re getting inked.\n\nWhat to look for in a tattoo shop or artist\n\nIf you know what you want, consider it a sign that you\u2019re ready to take the next step: Shopping for an artist. Ask your friends to see if they can refer you to a specific shop, or let Google or Instagram point you in the right direction.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should keep in mind while you\u2019re sifting through your options:\n\n1. Make sure your artist and the shop has proper licensing\n\nA quick Google search will show you what your state\u2019s rules and regulations are for tattoo licensing. Each state is different, so it\u2019s important to be familiar with the guidelines in your area.\n\nOnce you know what you\u2019re looking for, make sure the shop and artist you\u2019re interested in are certified. The parlor\u2019s licensing should be prominently displayed on their website and on the shop wall.\n\n2. Keep an eye out for hygiene and general health habits\n\nMost reputable shops smell like disinfectant and have spotless workstations and floors. If it smells like month-old gym socks, immediately turn tail and head to the next place on your list.\n\nAssuming the shop passes your visual inspection, you\u2019ll want to talk to your potential artist about their tattooing practices. Artists are required to use single-use needles and ink to avoid cross contamination. This also applies to gloves, bandages, swabs, razors \u2014 anything that your artist might use must be new.\n\n3. Gauge shop courtesy and ask if the artist offers consultations\n\nLast but not least, take note of the shop and artist\u2019s general professionalism and personality. You\u2019re about to trust someone to permanently etch a piece of artwork into your skin, and in order to do this, you have to be comfortable with the artist and with their work.\n\nYou want the artist to be as excited as you, or at least understand your passion. But remember, they aren\u2019t required to work with you just because you like their portfolio.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t meshing well or just not digging the overall vibe in the shop, it\u2019s more than okay to move along to the next one. Just be sure to thank the artist for their time before you see your way out.\n\nWhat a session is like and things to ask your artist\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far into our guide, it\u2019s safe to say that you have all your bases covered.\n\nTo wrap things up, here\u2019s how your interaction with your artist and getting your tattoo done will likely unfold:\n\n- Reach out to the artist or shop to talk about rates and set up a consultation.\n- Meet the artist to talk about your design and expectations.\n- Agree upon the final design with the artist and confirm the rate. If revisions are needed, this may involve setting up a follow-up appointment to look over the final design before locking in your tattoo date.\n- Aspirin (Bayer) and ibuprofen (Advil) are off limits in the 24 hours leading up to your appointment, as they can thin your blood. This applies to the consumption of alcohol as well. You may be able to take acetaminophen (Tylenol), but confirm this with your artist beforehand.\n- Plan to wear something that will keep the area to be tattooed exposed. If you can\u2019t do this, wear something you can easily slip in and out of.\n- Show up to your appointment 10 minutes early. Don\u2019t forget to bring cash for tips!\n- Fill out any paperwork and, if needed, finalize any details of your design.\n- Your artist will take you to their station. You may need to roll up or remove any clothing that may be in the way of your tattoo placement.\n- Your artist will disinfect the area and use a disposable razor to remove any hair.\n- Then your artist will place the tattoo stencil onto your skin. Move this around as much as you like until you\u2019re happy with the placement!\n- Once the placement is perfect, your artist will tattoo the outline of your design before filling in any colors or gradients.\n- After your artist is finished, they\u2019ll clean the tattooed area, wrap it up, and tell you how to take care of it.\n- Don\u2019t forget to leave a tip for your artist when you pay! It\u2019s standard to tip at least 20 percent, but if you had an awesome experience and are able to tip more, go ahead.\n- If you have any lingering questions, ask before you leave the shop. One of the best times to get them answered is when your artist is wrapping your skin.\n\nSince you\u2019re here, screenshot or print out this handy list of questions for your consultation before you commit to an artist.\n\nThings to ask before you get your tattoo\n\n- How long have you been tattooing? Apprentices can provide great work, but some designs are best left to veteran artists.\n- What are your qualifications? Some artists favor specific styles, even if they can do more general styles.\n- Can I see your portfolio? A reputable artist will have a portfolio of past work on hand so that you can get a sense of their range and specialties.\n- Do you guarantee your work? Sometimes small spots of ink or other blemishes can occur during the healing process. Most artists offer one free touch-up appointment to take care of these areas.\n- What\u2019s your hourly rate? It doesn\u2019t matter if your piece will take 15 minutes or 2 hours \u2014 most artists have an hourly rate, or minimum, that must be met before they\u2019ll agree to a piece. Others price on a piece-by-piece basis.\n- How do you sanitize your equipment? If they can\u2019t answer this question, it\u2019s off to the next one. Poor sanitation practices can lead to an infection or worse.\n- Do you have latex-free gloves? This is especially important if you have a latex allergy.\n- What brand of ink do you use? Again, if you have allergies to specific ingredients or materials, now is the time to bring them up.\n- What placement would you recommend for this design? Maybe you\u2019re determined to get tattooed on the inside of your ankle, but they think the piece would work better on the inside of your calf. You need to be happy with the outcome, but remember that they\u2019re the expert.\n- What aftercare procedure do you recommend? Reputable artists will have this information ready to go so that you know what to expect after your piece is complete.\n\nWhat does getting a tattoo feel like?\n\nBefore you ask: Yes, it\u2019s going to hurt. But how much it hurts depends on your pain tolerance, size, and location. Tattoos tend to hurt more around sensitive areas that have more nerves and less flesh. But if you\u2019ve got skin made out of steel, you probably won\u2019t feel a thing. This is especially true if you opted for a meatier location, like your bicep or thigh.\n\nMore painful areas tend to include the:\n\n- forehead\n- neck\n- spine\n- ribs\n- hands or fingers\n- ankles\n- top of your feet\n\nPro tip: The fleshier the area, the less it\u2019ll hurt. It\u2019s probably going to hurt a little no matter where you put it, but most artists agree that the areas listed above tend to hurt worse than others.\n\nWhat else will I feel?\n\nDepending on the piece, you may feel:\n\n- Scratching. This is more common with tattoos that require shading.\n- Sharp stinging. Although this is usually associated with detailing, it may also happen with tattoos on areas with tighter skin, like your wrist.\n- Burning. This is the most common feeling, and it\u2019s caused by the needle going over the same spot multiple times. Take a deep breath! It\u2019ll be over before you know it.\n- Vibrating. This is more common with tattoos in bonier areas, like your ribs or on your foot.\n- Dullness. All feelings will eventually melt into a dull roar. Once you reach this point, you\u2019re home free.\n\nHow to tackle potential pain\n\nIf the area in question is prone to pain, this will be a great time to get in touch with your meditative side and practice some deep breathing techniques. If at any point the pain becomes too much, let your artist know. A good artist will get to a stopping point and allow you to take a breather. Use this time to get your head back in the game.\n\nHow to care for your tattoo\n\nA general rule of thumb is to keep the dressing on for a few hours \u2014 especially if you plan on spending the rest of the day out and about. When you get home, be sure to wash your hands before you remove the dressing. Remember, a fresh tattoo is an open wound. Dirt or bacteria can damage it or slow the healing process.\n\nAfter you take the dressing off, wash the tattoo with your artist\u2019s recommended cleanser or a gentle, unscented soap. You should avoid using any soap with fragrances or alcohol, as these ingredients can cause irritation.\n\nAfter you wash, gently pat the area dry with a clean towel. Whatever you do, don\u2019t rub! Rubbing can pull at the skin and may cause ink fallout.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with itchy, dry skin, apply a thin layer of your artist\u2019s recommended ointment or a gentle, unscented lotion. As with the cleanser, you should avoid using anything with irritants like fragrance or alcohol.\n\nMost artists will give you a verbal rundown of how to take care of your new ink and send you home with a handout to reference later. You should always follow your artist\u2019s aftercare instructions.\n\nIf the tattoo starts to flake or peel, don\u2019t panic. This is a normal part of the healing process, and it usually only lasts through the end of the first week. Just don\u2019t pick at it \u2014 this can lead to ink fallout and ruin your art.\n\nHow to maintain your tattoo\n\nMost tattoos heal at the surface layer within the first couple of weeks, but it may be months before it\u2019s healed completely. Skimping on care can delay the healing process and also affect how your tattoo looks in the long term.\n\nPracticing good hygiene is the only way to reduce your risk for infection. See your doctor right away if you begin experiencing:\n\n- skin that\u2019s warm or tender to the touch\n- a burning sensation\n- swelling after the first couple of days have passed\n- green or yellow pus\n- foul odor\n\nIn addition to keeping the tattoo clean, you want to keep it fresh and hydrated. Exposing the tattoo to direct sunlight can cause the colors to fade, so invest in a quality sunscreen or SPF clothing. Dry skin can also cause a tattoo or the ink to look dull.\n\nStill have questions?\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about taking care of your tattoo.\n\nIf you changed your mind\n\nTattoos may not be forever, but they\u2019re pretty close. Although many people can and do get tattoos successfully removed, there\u2019s no real guarantee that these methods will always work. It all depends on the tattoo size, the type and color of ink that was used, and how deep the artist went with their tools.\n\nRemoval is also expensive and often more painful than getting the tattoo itself. And despite what some internet hacks may claim, the only way to remove a tattoo is through a surgical procedure.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Laser therapy. After injecting the area with a local anesthetic, your surgeon will use targeted energy pulses to heat and shatter the tattoo ink. Multiple sessions are needed to fade the tattoo.\n- Surgical excision. Your surgeon will inject the area with a local anesthetic before using a scalpel to remove the tattooed skin. The edges of the surrounding skin are sewn together. This usually leaves a scar and is only recommended for small tattoos.\n- Dermabrasion. After numbing the area, your surgeon will use a high-speed device to sand away the inked layers. The area will be sore and raw for about two weeks after the procedure. Due to its unpredictable results, this method is used less commonly.\n\nIf you do decide that you want to get a tattoo removed, set up an appointment with your healthcare provider or dermatologist. They can talk through the different procedures available and answer any questions you may have.\n\nIn some cases, it may be easier \u2014 and more affordable \u2014 to get a new tattoo to hide the old tattoo. An artist can walk you through your cover-up options and advise you on what comes next.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nYou may be itching to get your new tattoo right away, but it takes time to get the details just right. The last thing you want is to cut corners on price or location and wind up with a shoddy tattoo \u2014 or an infection.\n\nPatience will pay off in the long run, so be sure to explore all of your options until you find what works for you. And if you have a great experience, your first tattoo doesn\u2019t have to be your last! Keep adding to your canvas and embrace the confidence that it gives.",

        "clean content": "8 things you need to know before getting your first tattoo\n\nIt's going to hurt.\n\nFirsts are always memorable, and your first tattoo is no different. Think about your first piercing or the first time you had a professional do your hair/nails/makeup. It's kind of like that, only times 1,000 because it's usually pretty permanent.\n\nThat's why doing your homework to make sure you're prepared for the occasion is so important. Remember, you're putting a piece of art on your body that's going to be with you for a long time. That's worth more than a few minutes of serious thought. INSIDER rounded up all of the things you need to know before getting your first piece of tattooed art.\n\nDon't make any tattoo decisions lightly.\n\nIt's best to think long and hard about what design you want to get before you sit in that chair. A beautiful design can bring you joy forever, but you'd better be extremely sure about putting any person's name on your body. You'll probably love your mom and your kids forever but think twice about inking the name of anyone else. Cover-up tattoos are a thing for a reason. Tattoo removal can be done as well \u2014 but it can also be expensive and painful. Wouldn't you rather take the time now to carefully decide on a design that you know will delight you for years to come?\n\nResearch, research, research.\n\nAsk your friend with the ink you love who their artist is and how to contact them. Or try scoping out tattoo artists whose work truly moves you on Instagram to get a feel for what you want. Tattoo artist Horitomo of State of Grace Tattoo in San Jose, CA told INSIDER that people should always come armed with a few basic questions: \"Is the style of the artist and the tattoo compatible with each other? Meaning, is that something the artist is willing to take on? How does he/she work? Are there any deposits required? What is the cancellation policy?\" In-demand artists will be booked for months, so the sooner you figure out who you'd like to ink you, the better. A talented tattoo artist will listen to your description of what you want, then propose a design before setting your appointment(s). Do enough research beforehand that you know you love that artist's interpretations. Both you and your tattoo artist will be happy, and your design will be exactly what you want. Please note: Elaborate and/or very large designs will likely take more than one session, so plan accordingly.\n\nMake sure both your tattoo artist and the shop have your safety in mind.\n\nDifferent states have different requirements for tattoo artists. Some require individual artists to have licenses, while others only require that shops be licensed by the local health department. States may or may not require that tattoo artists pass a bloodborne pathogens training certification, as well. Some cities, such as New York City, might have requirements of their own \u2014 on top of any state requirements. Besides checking that any shop you're considering complies with local laws, you should also take a good look at the facilities themselves. Are they sparkling clean and full of non-porous surfaces? You want a place with good sanitation, where your artist unwraps new, single-use needles in front of you and prepares fresh ink that hasn't been used before. Remember, a new tattoo is essentially a very beautiful open wound. \"A porous surface, like rock and marble, would not be something that your tattoo station should be made of. It should be stainless steel, or [another] sterilizable material,\" celebrity tattoo artist Bang Bang McCurdy told Seventeen.\n\nDon't haggle. Also, be ready to tip.\n\nThink about your hair. When you go to a salon, you want the best. You've researched, you know what you're getting, and you're ready to pay. Why would you treat the artist who's going to put a piece of art on your skin for years \u2014 maybe even a lifetime \u2014 any differently? Don't be cheap, and don't haggle. As in any other field, a great tattoo artist has earned the right to charge what they charge. Also: Tattoo artistry is a field where tips are always appreciated.\n\nCome to the shop prepared on the day of your appointment.\n\n\"Get a good night's sleep the night before. Mentally prepare yourself as well. Getting a tattoo can be a mental game as much as it's a physical game,\" Horitomo told INSIDER. \"Eat a solid meal that day before your appointment and bring some snacks with you if you want. You don't want to get low blood sugar during the procedure.\" Yes, it will hurt, but great art can be worth the pain.\n\nBe ready, willing, and able to do all the aftercare steps your tattoo artist suggests.\n\nA new tattoo takes about two weeks to heal. From the time you leave your artist's chair until it's fully healed, your new piece of skin art is an open wound that you'll need to tend very carefully, both to protect the art and to avoid infection. It's in your best interest to listen to your expert tattoo artist about aftercare and follow their rules rigorously and to the letter. Your tattoo artist will most likely suggest using something like A + D ointment or Aquaphor over your new ink. Slather that stuff on religiously. Also: Don't plan to go swimming or soaking in a tub during the time that it's healing. You can shower (please, please keep the area clean), but definitely pat the newly tattooed area dry when you're done. Don't even think about rubbing it. Finally, keep that area out of the sun while it's healing, and don't wear any clothing that's likely to stick to it.\n\nYou'll probably need touch-ups in the future.\n\nAreas of your body where skin cells turn over more frequently (such as hands and feet) will definitely need touch-ups. Any part of your tattoo that's regularly exposed to sun or soaking in water will probably need touching up, as well. In fact, over time, most tattoos will need touch-up work to continue looking their best. Most tattoo artists guarantee their work and will do touch-ups either for free or a nominal charge. Check with your tattoo artist for their specific policies, and this can't be said enough: Don't forget to tip!",

        "clean content": "First Tattoo Tips: Advice for Beginners From Tattoo Artists\n\nSo you've filled a folder on Instagram with bookmarks of tattoo inspiration and determined you're finally ready to get your first tattoo. Not sure what happens next? We've got you.\n\nTo prepare you for permanently adding art to your skin, we compiled a comprehensive guide to getting your first tattoo. Allure asked tattoo artists to share their insight on every step of the process. You'll know exactly what to expect when making and preparing for your appointment, arriving at the tattoo studio, and finalizing your design. They'll also break down what to do while you\u2019re getting tattooed and after your inaugural ink is done. We can't say these tips will make the tattoo less painful, but the process is sure to be not as intimidating and more memorable.\n\nPicking an Artist\nIn case you haven't selected the exact tattoo artist to do the honors of giving you your first tattoo just yet, Portland-based tattoo artist Brit Abad recommends picking one you trust and see yourself having fun with during the process. \"Follow them online and gather a sense of who they are as a person,\" she explains. \"Having a great experience actually getting the tattoo often has a huge effect on how a person feels about the tattoo on their body. Love your artist and you'll love the artwork even more.\"\n\nWhile doing your research, New York City-based tattoo artist Ariel Wei advises checking out pictures of healed work, too. Tattoos fresh versus healed are different, she says. Colors often fade as the tattoo heals and lines become less distinct, so this type of research will help you get a full understanding of how your desired tattoo artist\u2019s work ages over time.\n\nMaking an Appointment\nDepending on which tattoo artist you go with, their preferred way of making an appointment will differ. Some have links on their Instagram or website to an online form for you to fill out with the exact information they need for booking. Others may ask you to send them an email. If that's the case, here\u2019s what you should include:\n\nYour desired design: Be as specific as possible about what you want, including whether you want color or not. Attaching reference images will be incredibly helpful for your artist to understand your vision, too. Just make sure you're not expecting your final design to look exactly like work from another artist.\n\nSize and placement: Instead of stating whether you want your tattoo to be small, medium, or large, Wei likes for her clients to put the dimensions in inches. Don't worry about being exact, though. The size as well as the placement can be an estimate.\n\nAvailability: Another thing to be specific about is the dates and times that work best for you, so you won't have a lot of back and forth with the tattoo artist or their shop.\n\nSkin tone: Tattoo artists should be able to make a design work for you no matter what color your complexion may be. If you encounter an artist who tells you they don't work with deeper skin tones or give you a list of things and colors they can't do on you because of your skin tone, find someone else who is more accommodating and inclusive.\n\nPreparing For Your Appointment\nDepending on the design you have in mind, New York City-based tattoo artist Doreen Garner says you may need to go to the studio for a quick, in-person consultation before your appointment. \"If they weren't able to describe their tattoo clear enough for me to generate an image from their words, then it's about just elaborating on their idea,\" she mentions as a reason why you'd need one. Some of her clients also come in for a consultation so she can get a general idea of what type of shapes they are drawn to and what part of the body they work on, so \"the tattoo can complement that part the best,\" Garner adds.\n\nMost of the tattoo artists we talked to compared preparations for the actual tattoo appointment to that of a medical procedure. Be sure to get a good night's sleep, don't drink the night before, stay hydrated, and eat something before arriving at the tattoo studio. (You can also bring snacks to have while getting tattooed.) \"I definitely try to make sure my clients have a meal at least 30 minutes before the tattoo,\" Garner says.\n\nIf you happen to have any skin conditions like eczema that affect the area where you're hoping to get tattooed, Garner says to let your tattoo artist know ahead of time. If you're having a flare-up, you may have to delay your appointment. Try to avoid getting any cuts or tans on the area you're hoping to get tattooed, too, Wei adds.\n\nWhen You Arrive\nWhen you first arrive at the tattoo studio, you'll start off by washing your hands before filling out consent forms. Be sure to have your photo ID handy, and \"come at your scheduled time in order to give the artist time to prepare, clean up, and avoid overlap with other clients \u2014 especially to comply with COVID safety guidelines,\" Kang says.\n\nFinalizing Your Design and Placement\nAfter your consent forms are filled out, your tattoo artist will show you the design they mocked up for you. If you want to make any adjustments to it, all the tattoo artists we talked to agree you shouldn't be afraid to speak up, as the art is about to be on your body for the rest of your life. However, make sure your feedback is respectful. \"Remember you contacted this artist because you trust their vision,\" Abad says. \"That said, it's perfectly normal and OK to want changes made to your drawing, but communicating that politely, without insulting and showing mistrust is important.\"\n\nAlso, keep in mind that not all tattoos can be as tiny as you want them to be. Some lettering may need to be enlarged so they can be legible over time. And if you're hoping for it to be on the smaller side because you think it'll be easy to start with, \"that's totally fine, but the tattoo is not going to hurt any less,\" Garner says. \"The size of the tattoo isn't going to decrease the pain. I think that's a mistake people often make in the beginning.\"\n\nFrom there, a stencil will be made and placed onto your body where you want the tattoo to be. Again, the placement can definitely be changed \u2014 just let your artist know. A major thing to consider for placement is how the image could be distorted when you move the part of the body that it's on. \"Skin is not like paper,\" Wei explains. \"If you are not getting it in a flatter surface area, the tattoo may stretch and look not straight when you move, but this is completely normal.\" Abad adds she usually recommends having her clients walk around in front of the mirror to \"see how their tattoo will move with their body in normal life.\"\n\nSitting for the Tattoo\nWhen it's time for your actual tattooing to commence, you may notice your artist taking time to set up their supplies. While they do that, your artist will probably tell you where to sit or lay, so make yourself comfortable in that position.\n\nOnce the tattooist turns on their machine and gets going, try to stay as still as possible. If you start feeling lightheaded, uncomfortable, or need a break to stretch, just say so. The artist will probably do the same. \"The tattoo process is pretty intimidating in itself,\" Garner says. \"People have this idea that they have to lay down and endure it, but we're all human and most of the tattoo artists have also gotten tattoos so we understand what it's like.\"\n\nThe first moments of getting your tattoo will probably be the most painful. Don't worry \u2014 that feeling won't be as intense the whole time. \"As your body builds up natural adrenaline, the pain generally begins to taper off,\" Abad explains. \"Just keep this in mind to help you get through the pain of a tattoo.\"\n\nOnce you get used to the situation, you can gauge whether your artist is into chatting. Depending on the size and detail of your piece, \"some artists are comfortable with making small talk throughout the tattoo process, others prefer to concentrate on their work and find long conversations potentially distracting,\" Kang says. If you want, you can always watch something on your phone or listen to music, she adds.\n\nWrapping Things Up And Tipping\nOnce your tattoo is complete, your artist will bandage it up by either taping plastic wrap around it or placing a clear, medical-grade bandage on top of it. Then, it's time to settle your bill. Your artist or the manager of the studio will probably tell you the expected price of your tattoo after booking your appointment and tell you the preferred type of payment.\n\nA \"standard price\" for a tattoo doesn't exist. Every artist has a different rate, which can depend on the shop's minimum or their hourly rate. Either way, be respectful of their pricing as tattoos are permanent art and should be considered an investment, Wei says.\n\nAs for tipping, there is a standard: around 20 to 30 percent. \"Keep in mind, most artists pay at least 20 to 30 percent per tattoo for supplies, rent, and overall tattooing costs,\" Abad says. \"Also some things to consider with tipping is whether the artist is traveling or paying additional costs to have gotten to you to do your tattoo.\"\n\nAftercare\nBefore you leave, your artist will give you thorough aftercare instructions. Listen to them. They may even give you a handy information slip for reference, so hang onto that. \"Some artists may have different ways of taking care of the tattoo, but always listen to the artist \u2014 not your friend or cousin who has gotten a tattoo before,\" Wei says.\n\nIf your artist used plastic wrap to protect your tattoo, you can remove it after a couple of hours. For those with a clear bandage, like Saniderm, follow your artist's guidelines as many have different suggestions. After taking off both bandages, aftercare is about the same. Wash off the tattoo with mild, antibacterial soap, and lukewarm water. Let it air dry if you can, or pat it dry with a clean paper towel, Wei says.\n\nFrom there, some artists may recommend not moisturizing it for a day, while others may tell you to smooth on a thin layer of a healing ointment, and apply it just as often for two weeks. While it's healing, don't pick, scratch, or itch your tattoo \u2014 even if it's flaking. Also, avoid submerging your tattoo in water for two weeks and don't expose it to the sun. Once it is completely healed, use sunscreen to protect the tattoo and reduce the effects of the sun.\n\nAs for washing your tattoo after that first time, Abad recommends only doing so when you shower. \"Overwashing your tattoo can dry out your skin and cause more harm to the tattoo,\" she explains.\n\nFrom there, keep open communication with your artist if any issues arise. Otherwise, enjoy your new body art. We have a feeling you'll want a second tattoo soon enough. At least when the time comes, you'll be a seasoned veteran.",
